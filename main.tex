\RequirePackage[l2tabu, orthodox]{nag}

% ------ Main document class specification ------
% The draft option here prevents images being inserted,
%  and adds chunky black bars to boxes that are exceeding 
%  the page width (to show that they are).
% The oneside option can optionally be replaced by twoside if
%  you intend to print double-sided. Note that this is
%  *specifically permitted* by the UCL thesis formatting
%  guidelines.
%
% Valid options in terms of type are:
%  phd
%  mres
%  mphil
\documentclass[12pt,phd,a4paper,oneside]{ucl_thesis}

% Package configuration:
%  LaTeX uses "packages" to add extra commands and features.
%  There are quite a few useful ones, so we've put them in a 
%   separate file.
\input{MainPackages}

% My own packages
\input{MyPackages}

% Sets up links within your document, for e.g. contents page entries
%  and references, and also PDF metadata.
% You should edit this!
\input{LinksAndMetadata}

% And then some settings in separate files.
\input{FloatSettings} % For things like figures and tables
\input{BibSettings}   % For bibliographies

\input{MyCommands} % My commands

% These control how many number sections your subsections will take
%    e.g. Section 2.3.1.5.6.3
%  and how many of those will get put into the contents pages.

%\nobibliography*
% ^-- This is a dumb trick that works with the bibentry package to let
%  you put bibliography entries whereever you like.
% I used this to put references to papers a chapter's work was 
%  published in at the end of that chapter.
% For more information, see: http://stefaanlippens.net/bibentry

% If you haven't finished making your full BibTex file yet, you
%  might find this useful -- it'll just replace all your
%  citations with little superscript notes.
% Uncomment to use.

%  *must not* include spaces.
