\chapter{DUNE Near Detector-driven reweighting}
\label{sec:dune_ndrwt}

%% ND recap
As detailed in \citesec{sec:dune:nd}, the primary function of the DUNE Near Detector is to measure the spectrum of neutrino interactions prior to significant oscillations having taken place.
Having done this it should be able to predict the event rate at the far detector given a set of oscillation parameters.
However, the event rate measured in the ND is in fact the convolution of the neutrino flux, cross-section and detector effects (see \citeeq{eq:eventRateConv}).
As a result, neutrino oscillation experiments require the assistance of models to successfully constrain the oscillation parameters.
In particular, models of neutrino-nucleus interactions are required for tasks such as background estimation and to infer the neutrino energy from observed deposits in the detector.
It is therefore important that the near detector of an experiment be able to distinguish between these various models.

Unknown discrepancies between the observed ND data and the chosen neutrino interaction model must be propagated into the final systematic errors.
For an experiment attempting to make precision measurements of the oscillation parameters it is therefore important that these discrepancies be reduced.

Part of the ND's purpose is to constrain systematic uncertainties arising from the neutrino interaction modelling.
These constraints can then be propagated to the far detector.
Given that nuclear effects will differ for different target nuclei, it is considered important to collect interactions at the near detector on the same target material as at the far detector.
In the DUNE ND, ND-LAr (see \citesec{sec:dune:nd:lar}) fulfills this requirement.
Its large mass and the high intensity of the DUNE beam will allow it to collect a large number of neutrino interactions on liquid argon.

%Models of neutrino interaction are frequently found to not match observed data.

%% Presentation of DUNE energy spectrum
\citefig{fig:energyByMode} shows the energy spectrum of \numu and \anumu charged current interactions in ND-GAr (see \citesec{sec:dune:nd:gar}) for both FHC and RHC.
The spectrum is subdivided into true final state pion multiplicities. 
One can see that the energy range of the DUNE beam means that a wide range of event topologies will be present.
Additionally, one can see that the dominant final states are the ones containing no pions and ones containing a single charged pion.
However, a significant number of interactions will result in more complex final states.

Although ND-LAr will be a state of the art detector there are issues that exist with liquid argon TPCs that it will be unable to avoid.
Namely, the high density of liquid argon means that the primary particles produced in a neutrino interaction frequently interact and produce secondary particles.
This can make it difficult to correctly identify the final state and also correctly reconstruct the hadronic energy.
These secondary particle are often neutrons which make escape the detector without depositing energy or depositing a highly variable fraction of their energy as ionisation charge~\cite{Friedland_2019}.
Additionally, the dense medium may mean that low energy particles are not reconstructed, further biasing energy estimators.

ND-GAr will somewhat mitigate these issues by operating with gaseous argon at a pressure of 10~bar.
Although ND-GAr's lower target mass will lead to reduced statistics, it has advantages over ND-LAr in terms of particle identification.
This chapter consists of two studies relating to ND-GAr's ability to separate out the final states of neutrino interactions.
\citesec{sec:dune_ndrwt:simDetails} gives details of the simulation of ND-GAr used in both studies.
\citesec{sec:dune_ndrwt:pionMulti} attempts to evaluate ND-GAr's ability to separate out final states in order to identify cross-section mismodelling.
\citesec{sec:dune_ndrwt:rwt} discusses how the data gained from ND-GAr can be used to mitigate the effect of this cross-section mismodelling in the DUNE far detector.

\citesec{sec:dune_ndrwt:bdt} provides a description of a  tool that can be used to easily reweight an existing sample of MC events to resemble those of an alternative neutrino interaction generator.
This tool is used in the analyses detailed in this chapter.

%% Details on GENIE->NuWro BDT
\section{NuWro reweighting Boosted Decision Tree}
\label{sec:dune_ndrwt:bdt}

Generating fully reconstructed Monte Carlo samples with alternative neutrino interaction generators is a process that consumes many CPU hours as well as requiring significant human effort to undertake.
Therefore, an alternative method is devised whereby existing samples can be reweighted on an event-by-event basis such that the true kinematic distributions of the reweighted sample can come to resemble those produced by an alternative neutrino interaction generator.

This reweighting is performed by a boosted decision tree (BDT).
This BDT is trained on two samples, termed the `nominal' and `mock'.
In this particular case, the `nominal' sample is GENIE~\cite{genie}, while the `mock' sample is NuWro~\cite{nuwro}.
This does require an additional sample of neutrino interactions to be generated but does not require the full simulation and reconstruction chain.

GENIE and NuWro differ in a number of ways in the manner in which they simulate neutrino interactions.
While both generators use similar models for some interaction modes, GENIE uses the Rein-Sehgal model~\cite{reinSehgal} for resonant pion production while NuWro uses its own method.
Resonant pion production occurs when a neutrino interacts with a nucleon and causes an excitation into a baryon resonance. 
This resonance then decays, resulting in the emission of a pion.
Example reactions of this kind are 
\begin{align}
	\numu + p &\rightarrow \muminus + \Delta^{++} \rightarrow \muminus + p + \piplus \\
	\numu + n &\rightarrow \muminus + \Delta^{+} \rightarrow \muminus + p + \pizero \, . 
\end{align}
Furthermore, GENIE uses the INTRANUKE-hA model~\cite{intranuke} to simulate final state interactions (FSI) while NuWro uses its own model of intranuclear cascades~\cite{nuwroCascade}.

For each of the samples, 18 truth level variables describing the neutrino interaction are used as the inputs to the BDT.
These 18 variables broadly fall into two categories, those concerning the kinematics of the interaction and those concerning final state particles. Those in the former category are the neutrino energy, the outgoing lepton energy, the angle between the outgoing lepton and the neutrino, the squared four momentum transfer ($Q^{2}$), the hadronic invariant mass ($W$), Bj\"orken $x$ and the inelasticity of the collision ($y$).
In the latter category the variables are the number and total energy of final state protons, neutrons, \piplus, \piminus and \pizero. 
Finally, the number of electromagnetic objects in the final state (for example photons) is also used.
The BDT is then trained to classify interactions as either the `nominal' or `mock' based upon these variables.
The output of the BDT is then used to weight `nominal' events~\cite{vilelaBDT}.

\section{Simulation details}
\label{sec:dune_ndrwt:simDetails}

Initially, a sample of \num{10000000} neutrino interactions (\num{5000000} in each of FHC and RHC mode) is simulated using the GENIE neutrino interaction generator within the HPgTPC volume.
This number of interactions is roughly what would be expected given the delivery of \num{9.66d20} protons to the neutrino beam target in FHC mode and \num{1.96d21} protons to the same target in RHC mode.
The final state particles produced in these interactions are then propagated through an accurate representation of the DUNE near detector hall (see \citesec{sec:dune:nd}) using \texttt{GEANT4}~\cite{geant}. 
 
A parametrised reconstruction is then used to give an estimate of the measured energy of these particles.
The parametrised reconstruction takes the \texttt{GEANT4} energy deposits and smears them according to the Gluckstern formula~\cite{gluckstern}.
This formula allows the error on a track's curvature (due to motion in a magnetic field) to be estimated.
This can then be extended to give the fractional uncertainty on the particle momentum as
\begin{align}
	\left(\frac{\sigma_{p}}{p}\right)^{2} &= \left( \frac{\sigma_{x} p}{0.3 B L^{2}} \sqrt{ \frac{720}{N+4} } \right)^{2} \nonumber \\
	&+ \left( \frac{\SI{0.0157}{\GeV\per\clight}}{0.3BL}\sqrt{\frac{L}{X_{0}}}\left( 1 + 0.038 \ln(L/X_{0}) \right) \right)^{2}
\end{align}
where $L$ is the track length perpendicular to the magnetic field, $\sigma_{x}$ is the point resolution, $N$ is the number of hits in the track and $X_0$ is the radiation length of the material which the particle is traversing.
In the HPgTPC, $B$ is taken to be \SI{0.4}{\tesla}, $X_{0}$ is taken to be \SI{13}{\cm}, $\sigma_{x}$ is taken to be \SI{1}{\mm} and the number of track hits is estimated by dividing the track length by the pad pitch of the HPgTPC.
Charged particles with track lengths of more than \SI{6}{\cm} are considered to be able to be reconstructed using this method.

It is assumed that charged pions and protons with $p < \SI{1.5}{\GeV\per\clight}$ are able to be perfectly separated using measurements of particle \dedx.
\citefig{fig:pep4dedx} shows the measurements of particle \dedx as a function of momentum at the PEP-4/9 experiment. 
One can see that at momenta above \SI{1.5}{\GeV\per\clight} the \dedx measurements for protons and pions become similar relative to the \dedx resolution.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{files/figures/dune_ndrwt/pep4_dedx_reproduction}
	\caption[PEP-4/9 TPC-based particle identification from \dedx]{Reproduction of PEP-4/9 TPC-based particle identification from \dedx, from~\cite{pep4}. In this case the gas mixture is argon-methane in a ratio of 80:20. The coloured lines show the most probable value for each particle type.}
	\label{fig:pep4dedx}
\end{figure}

Above this momentum a parametrisation of the ECAL is used to distinguish protons and pions.
Here, the reconstructed energy of the particle in the ECAL is estimated with a resolution of 
$20\% + \frac{30\%}{\sqrt{T / \si{\GeV}}}$, where $T$ is the kinetic energy of the particle.
This parametrisation is determined by eye from \citefig{fig:caliceParam} which shows the energy resolution for the CALICE hadronic calorimeter (HCAL).

This detector is somewhat similar to the proposed calorimeter surrounding ND-GAr.
This estimate of the energy is then compared with that derived from the momentum measurements made using track curvature under the assumption that the particle is a proton or a pion.
The closer of these two values to the reconstructed ECAL energy determines the reconstructed particle type.

	\caption[Charged pion energy resolution as a function of energy in the CALICE HCAL.]{Charged pion energy resolution as a function of energy in CALICE hadronic calorimeter, from~\cite{hcalParam}.}
	\label{fig:caliceParam}
\end{figure}

Neutral pions are considered to be reconstructed if both decay photons have energies of more than \SI{50}{\MeV} and the angle between the two photons is larger than 0.01~radians (i.e. they do not lie on top of one another).
It is assumed that for photons $\sigma_{E}/E = 0.1$.

Finally, a degree of confusion between muons and charged pions is implemented.
If the highest momentum muon or charged pion is a muon then the particle is correctly identified.
However, if a charged pion has a higher momentum there is a chance for the particle to be incorrectly reconstructed as a muon.
This probability varies depending on the energy regime of the charged pion.

If the charged pion has a momentum of less than \SI{0.4}{\GeV\per\clight} it is assumed that it can be correctly identified from its range within the ECAL.

For pions in the energy range $\SI{0.4}{\GeV\per\clight} < p < \SI{1.0}{\GeV\per\clight}$ the pion is correctly identified if it interacts in the ECAL.
The probability for a pion to leave the ECAL without interacting is determined from \citefig{fig:interactionSpline}.
\citefig{fig:interactionSpline} shows the probability for a pion to not interact in the ECAL at various momenta with a spline plotted through the points.
These points are determined from Monte Carlo simulations of the ECAL.

	\caption[Non-interaction probability for a charged pion travelling through the ND-GAr ECAL as a function of momentum.]{Non-interaction probability for a charged pion travelling through the ND-GAr ECAL as a function of momentum. Points derived from simulation are shown in red through which a spline is plotted (black).}
	\label{fig:interactionSpline}
\end{figure}

Charged pions with $p>\SI{1}{\GeV\per\clight}$ are considered to have passed into the muon identification system. 
This system has a thickness of approximately 2 interaction lengths for charged pions.
If the pion interacts in the muon identification system, it is correctly identified.
Therefore, these pions have a probability of $e^{-3}$ to be misidentified as muons.

Finally, it is assumed that the detector is able to perfectly sign select particles such as charged pions and muons if the associated track is greater than the \SI{6}{\cm} threshold.

\section{Measurements of pion multiplicity}
\label{sec:dune_ndrwt:pionMulti}

The DUNE near detector must be able to determine if the assumed neutrino interaction model is discrepant with the observed data.
These discrepancies may be particularly visible from observing certain final state kinematic distributions, divided up by final state.
To assess the ability of ND-GAr and ND-LAr to observe these discrepancies a sample of `mock data' with the characteristics of the NuWro interaction generator is produced with the BDT detailed in \citesec{sec:dune_ndrwt:bdt}.
%These different interaction models may lead to observable changes in the kinematics of the neutrino interaction.
%These changes may be especially observable if the neutrino interactions are separated by final state. 

In order to assess the ability of the ND-GAr detector to see these differences the simulation and parametrised reconstruction detailed in \citesec{sec:dune_ndrwt:simDetails} is used.
These measurements are detailed in \citesec{sec:dune_ndrwt:pionMulti:gar}.

A similar simulation and parametrised reconstruction is used to attempt to make the same measurements in ND-LAr. 
The results from this approach are shown in \citesec{sec:dune_ndrwt:pionMulti:lar}.

\subsection{ND-GAr}
\label{sec:dune_ndrwt:pionMulti:gar}

The parametrised reconstruction detailed in \citesec{sec:dune_ndrwt:simDetails} is used to select muon neutrino events and classify their final state.
An event is considered to be a \numu or \anumu charged current event if there is a reconstructed muon in the final state which has a track length perpendicular to the magnetic field of over \SI{1}{\metre}.
Alternatively, if the reconstructed muon exits the HPgTPC and ranges out in the ECAL it is also reconstructed as a \numu CC event.
The term `ranging out' here refers to a particle stopping in the detector without interacting.
The muon is judged to have ranged out in the ECAL if it has a momentum of less than \SI{380}{\MeV\per\clight} when exiting the HPgTPC. 

\citefig{fig:confusMatPi} shows the confusion matrices produced using the above selection for both forward and reverse horn currents. 
Here one can see that, for all final states, the correct final state is reconstructed at least 88\% of the time.
%The largest probability for miscategorised events are NC events where single charged pion is wrongly reconstructed as a muon and the whole event is categorised as a $0\pi$ final state.
%However, one can see from \citefig{fig:eventCats}, that these represent a very small fraction of the total number of events.

	\label{fig:confusMatPi}
\end{figure}

The kinematic variable chosen for comparison is the squared momentum transfer, $Q^{2}$.
The reconstructed squared momentum transfer for CC muon neutrino events is defined as
\begin{equation}
Q^{2}_{\textrm{reco}} = 2E_{\nu, \textrm{reco}} \left( E_{\mu, \textrm{reco}} - p_{\mu, \textrm{reco}} \cos \left( \theta_{\mu, \textrm{reco}} \right) \right) - m_{\mu}^{2}
\end{equation}
where $E_{\nu, \textrm{reco}}$ is the sum of the reconstructed muon energy and the other reconstructed final state particle energies, $E_{\mu, \textrm{reco}}$ and $p_{\mu, \textrm{reco}}$ are the reconstructed energy and momentum of the final state muon and $\theta_{\mu, \textrm{reco}}$ is the reconstructed angle between the muon and the neutrino beam.

The mock data generator detailed in \citesec{sec:dune_ndrwt:bdt} is used to reweight events to give an approximation of NuWro data.
A distribution of $Q^{2}_{\textrm{reco}}$ is then constructed for each of the nominal GENIE sample and the NuWro `mock data' sample. 
The ratio between the two samples is then taken and plotted. 

These ratios are shown in \citefigL{fig:Q2CompFhc} and \citefigL{fig:Q2CompRhc}. 
Here, one can clearly see that, for all final states apart from $0\pi$, clear differences between GENIE and NuWro are observable.

The errors on the points in \citefigL{fig:Q2CompFhc} and \citefigL{fig:Q2CompRhc} represent estimates of the systematic uncertainty on the measurement resulting from confusion between the final states and are estimated using the following method.
Distributions of $Q^{2}_{\textrm{reco}}$ are produced for each of the $i$ true final states for GENIE and NuWro and then the ratio between the two is calculated as before.
For the final state in question, $x$, the value of $n$th bin in this histogram is taken as the true central value $R_{\textrm{CV}, x}(n)$.
The variance of the $n$th bin is calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{x}^{2}(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{5} \left( R_{i}(n) - R_{\textrm{CV}, x}(n) \right)^{2} * \frac{M_{i x}}{N_{x}}
\end{equation}
where $i$ runs over the final states and $M$ is the smearing matrix in \citefig{fig:confusMatPi} corresponding to the correct horn current.
The constant $N$ is a normalisation factor determined by summing the bin contents of row $x$ of the smearing matrix. 

Additionally, \citefigR{fig:Q2CompFhc} and \citefigR{fig:Q2CompRhc} show the equivalent distributions for true selections and variables. 
One can see that these distributions replicate many of the features of the reconstructed distributions well.

\subsection{ND-LAr}
\label{sec:dune_ndrwt:pionMulti:lar}

Attempts to simulate measuring the same quantities are also made in the liquid argon component of the DUNE near detector, ND-LAr (see \citesec{sec:dune:nd:lar} for details of the detector).
ND-LAr has some key differences to ND-GAr in the case of separating out final states, however. 
Due to the lack of a magnetic field covering ND-LAr, hadronic interactions are typically reconstructed calorimetrically.

Because liquid argon is a denser medium than gaseous argon final hadrons will may not result in a reconstructed track due to the very short distance travelled.
Additionally, very high energy hadrons are more likely to scatter in liquid argon, making track reconstruction difficult.

Finally, ND-LAr does not have an equivalent to the ECAL in ND-GAr.
This means that protons and pions can be separated by track $dE/dx$ only and is replicated in the \texttt{GEANT} simulation and parametrised reconstruction.

\citefig{fig:larConfusMat} shows the equivalent confusion matrix to \citefigL{fig:confusMatPi} for ND-LAr.
Here one can see that, although around 60\% of final states are reconstructed correctly, the performance is not at the level of ND-GAr.

\end{figure}

\citefig{fig:q2LarFhc} shows the ratio of NuWro to GENIE as a function of $Q^{2}_{\textrm{reco}}$ in ND-LAr.
This is the ND-LAr equivalent to the histogram shown in \citefigL{fig:Q2CompFhc}. 
Here, one can see that the errors are larger in most cases (compared to \citefigL{fig:Q2CompFhc}) due to the increased confusion between categories.
However, in spite of this, it still seems that significant differences are visible for some of the final state topologies in ND-LAr.

\section{Near detector-driven reweighting}
\label{sec:dune_ndrwt:rwt}

% Why we have a near detector
As mentioned in \citesec{sec:dune:nd}, one of the reasons for the inclusion of a near detector in a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment is to constrain various neutrino cross-section systematics.
However, it may be that existing neutrino interaction models and their associated uncertainties do not explain the observed reconstructed neutrino energy spectra.

In this case it may be necessary to use some data-driven measurement of the unoscillated neutrino event rate to attempt to correct the far detector flux.
An example of why this reweighting can be necessary is shown in \citefig{fig:fdSamplesPostFit}.
This shows the four far detector samples (one appearance and one disappearance for each horn current) used in a typical oscillation analysis.
For each sample the nominal GENIE MC is plotted in blue along with the NuWro `mock data' as black points.
The red line shows the post-fit result of an Asimov FD-only fit with all systematics at their nominal values. 
For the purposes of this fit the nominal MC is GENIE and the data is the NuWro `mock data'.
One can see that the post fit result lies very close to the `mock data'.

Here the true value of \dcp is \ang{90}, the mass ordering is normal and all other parameters are at the NuFit 4.0 best fit points~\cite{nufit4}. The error bars on the `mock data' correspond to statistical errors for an exposure of \SI{48}{\kilo\tonne\mega\watt\year} in each of FHC and RHC but the full MC statistics are used.}
	\label{fig:fdSamplesPostFit}
\end{figure}

It is observed that many of the systematic parameters have move from their nominal values in order to accommodate the differing shapes of the data and MC.
Additionally, several of the oscillation parameters move away from their true values.
Most notably, the value of \dcp moves from its true value (in this case) of \ang{90} to a best fit point of \ang{64.9}, a bias of \ang{25.1}.

This process is repeated at multiple different true values of \dcp and the bias in \dcp measured. 
The resulting bias as a function of \dcpTrue is shown in \citefig{fig:dcpBiasNoWgt}.
One can see that the bias in \dcp varies between being negligible and up to approximately \ang{32}. 

\begin{figure}[h]

	\label{fig:dcpBiasNoWgt}
\end{figure}

Given that there is a large variation in the observed bias and the value of \dcp is not known, a useful metric to judge the level of bias by is the value for which 68\% of biases are below.
In this case, this number is \ang{16.2}.

This can be compared with the expected DUNE resolution on \dcp, shown in \citefig{fig:dcpResDUNE}. 
One can see that these biases are comparable to the eventual expected \dcp resolution of DUNE at $\dcp = -\pi/2$.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{files/figures/dune_ndrwt/dcpResWithLines-cropped}
	\caption[\dcp resolution of DUNE as a function of exposure.]{\dcp resolution of DUNE as a function of exposure, from~\cite{Abi:2020qib}. Additionally, a line has been drawn indicating the maximal \dcp bias created by using this incorrect interaction model (blue). The green line indicates the 68\% limit of \dcp biases.}
	\label{fig:dcpResDUNE}
\end{figure}
A bias of this magnitude is obviously undesirable for an experiment seeking to make precision measurements.

If the near detector is included in these fits, many of the systematic parameters become constrained. 
However, the systematic uncertainties and oscillation parameters do not contain the required degrees of freedom to reproduce the measured spectra at the ND and FD. 
As a result, the minimum point of the fit has a very large $\chi^{2}$ and no useful information about the oscillation parameters can be extracted.

The rest of this section is dedicated to a discussion of how it is possible to use information from ND-GAr to reduce these out-of-model biases in the FD.
Specifically, ND-GAr measures events in 3 dimensions (a two-dimensional kinematic space divided up by final state) for both the nominal MC and the `mock data' sample and develops a set of weights.
The final states used are discussed in \citesec{sec:dune_ndrwt:rwt:states} while the kinematic space used is discussed in \citesec{sec:dune_ndrwt:rwt:kinematics}.
These weights are then propagated to DUNE far detector events. 
This process is described in \citesec{sec:dune_ndrwt:rwt:fd}.

\subsection{Choice of final states}
\label{sec:dune_ndrwt:rwt:states}

The reweighting is divided up into 7 final states for both horn currents.
The chosen final states are mainly based on final state pion multiplicity since the DUNE beam energies will produce a variety of multiplicities.
Additionally, \citesec{sec:dune_ndrwt:pionMulti} shows that ND-GAr has a high accuracy when identifying these final states.

The chosen final states are have a muon and one of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $0\pi$ with a single proton in the final state
	\item $0\pi$ with more than one proton in the final state
	\item $1\piplus$ in the final state
	\item $1\piminus$ in the final state
	\item $1\pizero$ in the final state
	\item $2\pi$ in the final state, their charge is not relevant
	\item $>2\pi$ in the final state, their charge is not relevant.
\end{itemize}

The choice is made to separate the $0\pi$ final state into two separate categories due to the different processes which contribute to these final states.
A signal proton final state is commonly produced via charged current quasi-elastic (CCQE) scattering which, for a free nucleon, can be represented by the reactions
\begin{align}
	\nul + n &\rightarrow l^{-} + p \\
	\anul + p &\rightarrow l^{+} + n \, .
\end{align}
In this case the $W$ boson is absorbed by just one nucleon.

However, in a 2p2h event the $W$ boson is absorbed by two interacting nucleons within the nucleus, potentially leading to two protons in the observed final state~\cite{2p2h}.
Because different neutrino interaction generators model these processes differently and with differing strengths, it is decided to divide the $0\pi$ category into these two final states to try and better observe any differences.

\subsection{Choice of variables}
\label{sec:dune_ndrwt:rwt:kinematics}

Two variables are defined in which the reweighting takes place, the visible energy transfer and the visible momentum transfer. 
These variables are termed \evis and \pvis respectively.
\evis is defined as 
\begin{equation}
	\evis = T_{\textrm{p}} + E_{\pi}
\end{equation}
where $T_{\textrm{p}}$ is the total kinetic energy of any final state protons and $E_{\pi}$ is the total energy (including rest masses) of any final state pions.
One can see that any energy carried by neutrons is not measured in this definition.

\pvis is defined as
\begin{equation}
	\pvis = \sqrt{ 2(\evis + E_{\mu})(E_{\mu} - p_{\mu}\cos\theta_{\mu}) - m_{\mu}^{2} + \evis^{2} }
\end{equation}
where $E_{\mu}$ and $p_{\mu}$ are the energy and momentum of the outgoing muon.
$\theta_{\mu}$ is the angle between the outgoing muon and incoming neutrino.

Distributions of true vs. reconstructed \evis and \pvis are shown in \citefig{fig:visibleTrueReco}.
One can clearly see that in both cases, the distributions are highly diagonal.

\end{figure}

Examples of 2-dimensional distributions of these quantities for various reconstructed final states are shown in \citefig{fig:q0q3Genie}.
One can observe substantial variations in the distributions as a function of final state.

	\label{fig:q0q3Genie}
\end{figure}

The same distributions as those displayed in \citefig{fig:q0q3Genie} are plotted for the NuWro mock data.
The ratio of these two distributions is then taken.
That is, the number of events in each bin for the mock data sample is divided by the number of events in the same bin for the nominal sample.
These ratios are shown for FHC in \citefig{fig:q0q3RatioFhc}.
In the case that any bin contains less than \num{100} MC events, its value is set to 1.
This avoids events being given large weights due to statistical fluctuations.

\subsection{Far detector samples}
\label{sec:dune_ndrwt:rwt:fd}

These weights shown in \citefig{fig:q0q3RatioFhc} are used to reweight the nominal far detector MC.
For each FD event the true final state is identified and true values of \evis and \pvis are calculated.
The true final state and horn current determines which reweighting histogram is used while the true values of \evis and \pvis determine the weight.

Far detector events are fully simulated and reconstructed within the \texttt{LArSoft}~\cite{larsoft} framework.
The event flavour is determined using a convolutional neural network~\cite{duneCVN}.
This CVN returns scores for each event to be a CC \numu, CC \nue, CC \nutau or NC event.
In order for an event to be classified as a \numu a the CVN probability for a \numu is required to be $>0.5$. 
In order to be selected as a \nue candidate, the CC \nue score must be $>0.85$. 

\citefig{fig:fdWeights} shows the distribution of weights applied to each far detector sample.
The weights are shown for both reconstructed \numu and \nue for both horn currents.
One can observe that these weights are mainly clustered around 1 but with a significant spread.

\end{figure}

An example of four far detector samples with and without the reweighting, together with the mock data is shown in \citefig{fig:reweightedSamples}.
One can observe significant shifts for all the MC samples after the reweighting has been performed.

	\label{fig:reweightedSamples}
\end{figure}

Additionally, the ratio to data for each of the MC samples is shown in \citefig{fig:reweightedSamplesRatio}.
\citefig{fig:reweightedSamplesRatio} also shows the calculated $\chi^{2}$ values for each MC sample when compared with the `mock data'.
Here, one can see that at this particular set of oscillation parameters the $\chi^{2}$ for all samples apart from \nue RHC is lower for the weighted sample than the unweighted one.
This falling $\chi^{2}$ indicates that the reweighting is bringing the MC closer to the mock data.

	\label{fig:reweightedSamplesRatio}
\end{figure} 

One can see that differences remain between the weighted MC and `mock data'. 
These differences are the result of a number of different factors.

Firstly, the far detector events are reweighted on the basis of true \evis and \pvis and true final state.
These quantities do not correspond directly to the reconstructed quantities measured in ND-GAr and thus there will be deficiencies in the reweighting deriving from this.
However, it is not possible to reweight based upon the reconstructed \evis and \pvis of far detector events due to the differences in reconstruction techniques between ND-GAr and the FD.
Additionally, it may be more difficult in the FD to exclude energy carried by neutrons from hadronic energy estimators.
A LAr TPC such as the FD may also find it more difficult to correctly identify final state pion multiplicities compared to ND-GAr, as shown in \citefig{fig:larConfusMat}.

Furthermore, many differences exist between the GENIE and NuWro which may not be encapsulated in the 3-dimensional reweighting space chosen.
An extension to further dimensions may mitigate these issues.
However, this approach relies on sufficient statistics in ND-GAr such that all parts of phase space are reasonably well populated.

Finally, an attempt was made to generate weights based upon only reconstructed \numu and \anumu events in ND-GAr.
The results of the reweighting could be improved by making kinematic measurements of \nue and \anue events in a similar fashion and then using this sample to separately reweight far detector \nue and \anue events.
However, this method relies on measuring enough electron neutrino interactions in ND-GAr.
This is expected to be a challenge given the significantly lower event rate for electron neutrinos (\num{2.85d4} CC events~/~ton~/~year compared with \num{1.64d6} \numu CC events~/~ton~/~year in FHC mode~\cite{ndCdr}).

\subsubsection{Charged-current inclusive weighting}

Additionally, an attempt is made to quantify how important the final state separating power of ND-GAr is when attempting to mitigate this bias.
To this end, the FD MC sample is reweighted using a smaller set of weights.
Specifically, a single two-dimensional histogram for each horn current is used to reweight FD events, regardless of the final state. 
Otherwise, the procedure remains unchanged.
The is referred to as the charged-current inclusive (CC inc.) weighting.

The two-dimensional histograms used for the reweighting are shown in \citefig{fig:ccIncWeightingHists}. 
The left histogram corresponds to FHC and the right corresponds to RHC.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Bias reduction as a function of \dcp}
\label{sec:dune_ndrwt:rwt:biasReduction}

Far detector fits are performed at a variety of values of \dcp with the reweighted far detector samples as the MC.
For all of these fits, the full set of flux, cross-section and detector systematics described in~\cite{Abi:2020qib} are set to their nominal values while the oscillation parameters are set to their NuFit~4.0~\cite{nufit4} values.
Of the oscillation parameters, the values of \thetai{13}, \thetai{23}, \deltami{32} and \dcp are determined in the fit while \thetai{12} and \deltami{21} are kept fixed.

\citefig{fig:dcpBiasWithWgt} shows the variation in the bias in the fitted value of \dcp as a function of \dcpTrue when using the reweighted MC samples.
The points made by using the unweighted MC are also included for comparison.
One can see that at most points, the bias on \dcp is lessened when the weighted MC is used.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\begin{adjustbox}{max totalsize=.75\linewidth, center}
		\input{files/figures/dune_ndrwt/dcpBiasWithWgt}
	\end{adjustbox}
	\caption[Bias in fit value of \dcp with ND-GAr reweighted MC.]{Bias in the measured value of \dcp as a function of the true value of \dcp. Points for both the nominal GENIE MC and the reweighted MC are shown.}
	\label{fig:dcpBiasWithWgt}
\end{figure}

Also, one can see that, although the CC inc. reweighting leads to a bias reduction at many points, the bias reduction is usually greater when using the weighting separated out by final state.

As mentioned above, a useful measure of the effect this reweighting has is the limit for which 68\% of biases fall below.
For the unweighted MC, this number is \ang{16.2}. 
With the full reweighting derived from ND-GAr this 68\% limits falls to \ang{4.4}, a significant reduction.

This is compared with the CC inc. weighting which has a 68\% limit on the \dcp bias of \ang{8.6}.
Therefore, it is clear that the ability to separate out final states is of great important when trying to mitigate these model discrepancies.
However, even with this simpler reweighting, the bias is significantly reduced.

Further work will also be required to correct the model such that the near detector samples can be included in the fit.
Even with this reweighting, the fit still fails due to a lack of systematic uncertainties than can replicate the remaining bias.
This is due to the very statistics of the ND samples used in the oscillation analysis.
If this situation occurred was observed in the data during experimental running, this remaining (much smaller) discrepancy would have to be incorporated into the final systematic error budget.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:dune_ndrwt:conclusions}

Throughout this chapter, it has been shown that ND-GAr has the ability to both identify cross-section mismodelling and to attempt to correct for it.

The identification of deficiencies in the cross-section model will be key in accurately deriving neutrino oscillation parameters, given the reliance of neutrino oscillation experiments on these models.
The ability to evaluate these models as a function of final state will be especially useful since this extra degree of freedom should allow some over-constraining of the interaction models.

The second study of this chapter shows that a data-driven correction to the MC is viable when using ND-GAr as the source of the correction.
However, there are also limitations to the method which are detailed above. 
Nevertheless, the study provides a useful proof-of-concept that such a method could work.

In the case that such a data-driven correction was found to be required, this work could also provide input to improvements in the theoretical models themselves.
Studies such as these would provide excellent inputs to models as multiple interaction modes can be constrained with the same detector.
