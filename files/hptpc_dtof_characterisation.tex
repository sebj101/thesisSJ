\chapter{Characterisation of the downstream time of flight system}
\label{sec:hptpc_dtof_characterisation}

This chapter discusses the characterisation of a time of flight system.
This time of flight system was used to identify particle species in a beam test at CERN during the summer of 2018.
Further details of this beam test are given in \citesec{sec:hptpc_beam_flux}.

\citesec{sec:hptpc_dtof_characterisation:dtof} describes the downstream time of flight system, while \citesec{sec:hptpc_dtof_characterisation:characterisation} describes the characterisation of the PMTs and bars.

\section{The downstream time of flight system}
\label{sec:hptpc_dtof_characterisation:dtof}

The downstream time of flight system (DToF) consists of 10 bars made up of Nuvia NuDET plastic scintillator which has a wavelength of maximum emission of \SI{425}{\milli\metre} and a decay time constant of \SI{2.5}{\nano\second}~\cite{nuvia}.
Each bar measures $\SI{10}{\centi\metre} \times \SI{1}{\centi\metre} \times \SI{140}{\centi\metre}$ with a curved cutout at either end.
The curved cutouts accomodate a 5'' Hamamatsu Photonics R6594 PMT~\cite{hamamatsu}.
A diagram of one such bar is shown in \citefig{fig:barDiag}.

  \label{fig:barDiag}
\end{figure}

The bars and PMTs are arranged in two rows of five bars to ensure complete coverage for any particles impinging on the detector.
This gives the DToF a total active area of $\SI{1.40}{\metre} \times \SI{0.78}{\metre}$.
\citefig{fig:dtofDiag} shows diagrams of the DToF system along with various dimensions of sections of the detector.
Each of the bars is wrapped individually in a reflective milar sheet in order to maximise the light yield as well as keeping external light out of the bar.

\end{figure}

Each of the PMTs is attached to the scintillator bar via a 3D-printed support which is glued to the bar.
A layer of optical grease is applied to the end of the scintillator bar where it meets the PMT.
This ensures good optical coupling between the PMT and scintillator bar and minimises light loss.

The vertical position of a particle striking the DToF can be determined by observing in which bar a signal is seen.
The horizontal position of the same particle can be inferred by measuring the time difference between signals being observed in PMTs at opposite ends of the same bar.

However, in order to effectively convert this time measurement to one of position, two factors must be measured.
Firstly, the relationship between the time difference in signals being observed in the PMTs and the position of a particle along the bar must be measured.
Secondly, the time (and therefore position) resolution of the bars and PMTs must be measured.
The procedure and results of these measurements are discussed in \citesec{sec:hptpc_dtof_characterisation:characterisation}.

\section{Characterisation of the bars}
\label{sec:hptpc_dtof_characterisation:characterisation}

\subsection{PMT characterisation}
\label{sec:hptpc_dtof_characterisation:characterisation:pmt}

Prior to testing the bars with the PMTs attached, the gain of each PMT is measured.
This is done in order to determine where to place each PMT within the detector.
A PMT with a higher gain will have a higher light collection efficiency and so will be more likely to detect light from a given charged particle.
These higher gain PMTs are attached to the bars upon which the beam centre impinges and so will observe the highest flux of particles.

The gain of a PMT can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  G = \frac{N_{\text{SE}}}{N_{\text{PE}}} \, ,
  \label{eq:gainEq}
\end{equation}
where $N_{\text{SE}}$ is the number of output signal electrons from the anode of the PMT and $N_{\text{PE}}$ is the number of photoelectrons liberated from the photocathode.
This gain measurement is performed by pulsing an LED lamp directly into the photocathode of each PMT with the same voltage used for each LED pulse.
The output waveform produced by the PMT is then read by an oscilloscope.
This testing is performed with the PMT inside a light-tight box.

$N_{\text{SE}}$ can be determined from the output PMT waveform in the following manner.
The waveform is in voltage units and can be converted to current by dividing by the resistance of the oscilloscope, $R$.
The relationship between charge, $Q$, and current, $I$, is given by
\begin{equation}
  Q = \int I(t) \, dt
\end{equation}
where $Q$ is in coulombs, $I$ is amperes and $t$ is in seconds.
Therefore, $N_{\text{SE}}$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  N_{\text{SE}} = \frac{1}{R q_{e}} \int V(t) \, dt
\end{equation}
where $q_{e}$ is the elementary charge of the electron.
This process is then repeated a number of times.
An example of the gaussian distribution produced from a number of waveforms is shown in \citefig{fig:N_se}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{adjustbox}{max totalsize={.8\textwidth}, center}
    \input{files/figures/hptpc_dtof_characterisation/n_se}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption[Signal electron multiplicity distribution for a PMT.]{Signal electron distribution for a PMT with a gaussian fitted (red).}
  \label{fig:N_se}
\end{figure}

$N_{\text{PE}}$ can be estimated from the distributions such as the one shown in \citefig{fig:N_se}.
The mean number of signal electrons produced by the PMT, $\mu_{\text{SE}}$, is proportional to the mean number of photoelectrons, $\mu_{\text{PE}}$.
The standard deviation of the distribution of $N_{\text{SE}}$, $\sigma_{\text{SE}}$, is proportional to $\sqrt{N_{\text{PE}}}$~\cite{photoelectrons}.
This is due to the fact that the number of photoelectrons liberated by a light pulse obeys Poisson statistics, with mean $\mu_{\text{PE}}$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{\text{PE}}$ (assuming the number of incident photons in constant).
Given that for a Poisson distribution, $\sigma_{\text{PE}} = \sqrt{mu_{\text{PE}}}$ and using \citeeq{eq:gainEq}, the mean number of photoelectrons produced by the LED pulse can be estimated as
\begin{equation}
  N_{\text{PE}} = \left( \frac{ \mu_{\text{SE}} }{ \sigma_{\text{SE}} }  \right)^{2} \, .
\end{equation}
The gain of the PMT can then be estimated by taking $N_{\text{SE}} = \mu_{\text{SE}}$ and using \citeeq{eq:gain}.

This process is repeated at multiple different PMT voltages with the gain being measured at each point.
An example of the relationship between voltage and gain is shown in \citefig{fig:gainEx}.
Here, a function of the form
\begin{equation}
  G = p_{0} V^{p_{1}}
  \label{eq:gain}
\end{equation}
is fitted, where the values of $p_{0}$ and $p_{1}$ are determined in the fit.
Each PMT is tested to ensure that its gain obeys this relationship.
Those PMTs which produce larger gains at a given voltage and whose voltage to gain relationships fit the analytic expectation well are attached to bars near the centre of the detector

  \label{fig:gainEx}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Measurements of bar time and position resolution}
\label{sec:hptpc_dtof_characterisation:characterisation:barRes}

In order to measure the time and position resolution of the bars, the PMTs are attached to the bars as stated in \citesec{sec:hptpc_dtof_characterisation:dtof}.
Following this, the bars are placed into a light-tight box to ensure that the PMTs do not observe light from outside sources.

A $^{90}\text{Sr}$ source is the primary tool used to evaluate the time and position resolution of the bars.
$^{90}\text{Sr}$ decays almost entirely via $\beta$-decay with an end-point of \SI{0.546}{\mega\electronvolt} to $^{90}\text{Y}$ which itself decays via $\beta$-decay with an end-point of \SI{2.28}{\mega\electronvolt}~\cite{strontium}.
These decay electrons are minimum-ionising particles, which means they have a similar energy loss profile to the particles the DToF is exposed to in the T10 beamline.
These electrons cause the bar to emit scintillation light as they traverse it.
This scintillation light is recorded by the PMTs at either end of the bar.

The $^{90}\text{Sr}$ source is placed at several measured points along the bar's long axis (\SI{16}{\cm}, \SI{32}{\cm}, \SI{48}{\cm} to the left and right of the bar centre).
The voltage of each PMT is adjusted to alter the size of the PMT signals such that, when a trigger of \SI{-15}{\milli\volt} is used, the average pulse minimum is \SI{-35}{\milli\volt}.
At each of these positions, 1000 waveforms are captured from each PMT at three different trigger levels (\SI{-10}{\milli\volt}, \SI{-15}{\milli\volt} and \SI{-20}{\milli\volt}).

The time difference between signal pulses is calculated by making a correlation graph of the two PMT pulses and finding the time of the maximum.
This maximum is taken as the time difference between signals.
This process is repeated for each trigger threshold and source position.
In each case a distribution such as the one shown in \citefig{fig:deltaTEx} is produced.
A gaussian is then fitted to the distribution (shown in red in \citefig{fig:deltaTEx}).
The difference in arrival times is taken to be equal to the mean of the gaussian while the time resolution is taken to be the standard deviation of the gaussian.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{adjustbox}{max totalsize={.8\textwidth}, center}
    \input{files/figures/hptpc_dtof_characterisation/deltaTEx}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption[Example of difference in signal arrival times for a PMT.]{Example of the difference in arrival times for a PMT. A $^{90}\text{Sr}$ source is held in a fixed position. A gaussian is fitted to the data points (shown in red).}
  \label{fig:deltaTEx}
\end{figure}

By measuring the difference in arrival time as a function of the $^{90}\text{Sr}$ position it is possible to derive a relationship between the two.
An example of such a distribution is shown in \citefigL{fig:barTimeDiffRes}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{minipage}[t]{.5\textwidth}
    \begin{adjustbox}{max totalsize={\textwidth}, center}
      \input{files/figures/hptpc_dtof_characterisation/barTimeDiff}
    \end{adjustbox}
  \end{minipage}
  \hfill
  \begin{minipage}[t]{.5\textwidth}
    \begin{adjustbox}{max totalsize={\textwidth}, center}
      \input{files/figures/hptpc_dtof_characterisation/barRes}
    \end{adjustbox}
  \end{minipage}
  \caption[Examples of bar time difference and time resolution as a function of source position.]{Left: Example of bar time difference as a function of $^{90}\text{Sr}$ source position for various trigger thresholds. Right: Example of bar time resolution as a function of $^{90}\text{Sr}$ source position for various trigger thresholds. }
  \label{fig:barTimeDiffRes}
\end{figure}

One can derive two pieces of information from \citefigL{fig:barTimeDiffRes}.
Firstly, the relationship between the source position and signal arrival time appears to be linear.
When a first order polynomial is fitted to the data points, one finds that the signal propagates down the bar at approximately \SI{7.5}{\cm\per\nano\second}.
This was found to be constant for all bars.
Secondly, the trigger threshold has no effect on the relationship between source position and signal arrival time difference.

\citefig{fig:barTimeDiffRes} right, shows that the time resolution remains roughly constant as a function of source position along the bar, with some slight variation depending on the trigger threshold used.
Lower trigger thresholds appear to slightly degrade the timing resolution.
Across all bars, the time resolution is found to be approximately \SI{0.9}{\nano\second}.
When combined with the measurement of the bar signal propagation, this equates to a position resolution of \SI{7}{\cm}.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:hptpc_dtof_characterisation:conclusions}

In this chapter the construction and characterisation of a time of flight system is described. 
As part of this characterisation, the time and position resolution of the system is measured.
The time resolution is found to be approximately \SI{0.9}{\ns} while the equivalent position resolution is measured as \SI{7}{\cm}.

This system is utilised during a 2018 beam test at CERN.
The resulting analysis is detailed in \citechap{sec:hptpc_beam_flux}.
