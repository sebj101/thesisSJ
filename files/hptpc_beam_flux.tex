\chapter{Measurements of the CERN T10 beam flux}
\label{sec:hptpc_beam_flux}

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:hptpc_beam_flux:motivation}

As mentioned in \citesec{sec:theory:currentState}, one of the targets of the next generation of long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments is the measurement of \dcp.
In order to make this measurement, systematic uncertainties will have to be significantly reduced.
In the current generation of neutrino oscillation experiments, uncertainties relating to the neutrino-nucleus interaction model make up a large part of the overall systematic budget.
For example, NOvA's most recent results assign systematic uncertainties from its interaction model of $3.2-5.8\%$ on its \nue and \anue signal rates~\cite{novaRecent}.
The T2K experiment has reported systematic uncertainties of $7-9\%$ on the rate of far detector electron-like events (after the near detector constraint has been applied) where cross-section uncertainties are the largest part of this~\cite{t2kRecent}.

Reducing these systematic uncertainties relies upon better modelling of neutrino-nucleus interactions.
It is also important to have an accurate interaction model in order to infer the neutrino energy from the observed events.
A illustrative diagram showcasing the dependence on the interaction model is shown in \citefig{fig:fsiDiag}.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \label{fig:fsiDiag}
\end{figure}

As \citefig{fig:fsiDiag} shows, in the simplest case a neutrino nucleus interaction (in this case a CC quasi-elastic one) can be thought of as a neutrino interacting with a free nucleon.
However, within a nucleus the nucleons are not static -- they have some initial momentum which will modify the kinematics of the outgoing particle.
Additionally within a nucleus, additional effects can occur due to correlations between nucleons.
Finally, as the outgoing particles propagate through the nucleus they can interact with other nucleons.
These `final state interactions' (FSI) can modify both the outgoing particles and their kinematics.

Given that in a detector only the outgoing particles can be observed, we are reliant on neutrino interaction models of the initial nuclear state, nuclear effects and FSI in order to correctly reconstruct the neutrino energy.
For example, at the DUNE experiment the primary neutrino interaction type is resonant single pion production, caused by the interaction of a neutrino with a nucleon within an argon nucleus.
This can be represented for muon neutrinos as
\begin{align}
  \numu + p &\rightarrow \muminus + \Delta^{++} \rightarrow \muminus + p + \piplus \\
  \numu + n &\rightarrow \muminus + \Delta^{+} \rightarrow \muminus + n + \piplus \\
  \numu + n &\rightarrow \muminus + \Delta^{+} \rightarrow \muminus + p + \pizero \, .
\end{align}

However, the pions emitted in this process can interact with other nucleons as they progress through the nucleus, leading to their absorption.
If this occurs, the outgoing pion will not be detected and the reconstructed hadronic energy will be biased by the mass of the pion.

Models of final state interactions are not consistent between different neutrino interaction generators.
Of the most commonly used neutrino interaction generators, GENIE~\cite{genie}, NuWro~\cite{nuwro} and NEUT~\cite{neut} all model FSI using intranuclear cascade models tuned on external hadron-nucleus scattering data.
The generator GiBUU~\cite{gibuu} meanwhile, solves the semi-classical Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck equation in order to simulate FSI.

However, proton-nucleus scattering measurements are either sparse or non-existent in the energy region of interest or on the desired nucleus.
This is shown in \citefig{fig:protonNucleus} which compares data with a semi-empirical model.
One can see that, for several of the displayed nuclei, large energy regions have no measurements.
This lack of data leads to different parametrisations being used by different neutrino interaction generators.

\begin{figure}[h]

The points represent data from~\cite{protonXSecData} while the curves are a semi-empirical model~\cite{protonXSecModel}. Figure from~\cite{hptpcProposal}.}
  \label{fig:protonNucleus}
\end{figure}

\citefig{fig:generatorProtons} shows that these differing parametrisations can lead to discrepant final state kinematics between the generators, particularly at low proton energies.
\citefig{fig:generatorProtons} also shows that much of the discrepancy lies below the proton track production threshold in liquid argon.
Mismodelling of these nuclear effects can lead to significant biases in the measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters~\cite{nuclearMismodelOsc}, an undesirable outcome for future long baseline experiments.


High pressure gas TPCs (HPgTPCs) provide an excellent opportunity to gather proton-nucleus data in these regions of very low proton energy due to low thresholds required for track reconstruction.
To this end, a HPgTPC prototype has been constructed and exposed to a charged particle beam at CERN.
In order to access a flux of low energy protons, the beam was moderated and the HPgTPC was placed in an off-axis position. 
An overview of the beam test is given in \citesec{sec:hptpc_beam_flux:overview} while measurements of the beam flux are presented in \citesec{sec:hptpc_beam_flux:results}

\section{The 2018 beam test}
\label{sec:hptpc_beam_flux:overview}

\subsection{The T10 beamline}
\label{sec:hptpc_beam_flux:overview:t10}

The beam test took place at the T10 beam line in the East Area at CERN.
The T10 beam is derived from the PS beam, consists primarily of protons, charged pions and electrons and has a momentum range of \SIrange{0.8}{6.5}{\giga\electronvolt\per\clight} (corresponds to a proton kinetic energy range of \SIrange{0.3}{5.6}{\giga\electronvolt})~\cite{t10Report}.

\citefig{fig:t10Calc} shows the calculated intensity of the T10 beam as a function of beam momentum, separated by particle species.
One can see that charged pions dominate at all momenta, with the effect becoming more pronounced at lower beam momenta.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{files/figures/hptpc_beam_flux/t10Comp}
  \caption[Calculated intensity of the CERN T10 beam as a function of selected beam momentum and particle species.]{Calculated intensity of the CERN T10 beam as a function of selected beam momentum and particle species, from~\cite{t10Report}.}
  \label{fig:t10Calc}
\end{figure}

\citefig{fig:unmoderatedBeam}, left, shows the time of flight spectrum for the unmoderated T10 beam at a momentum setting of \SI{0.8}{\giga\electronvolt\per\clight}.
In this case the baseline is \SI{10.8}{\metre}.
Within \citefig{fig:unmoderatedBeam}, left, there are several peaks caused by different particle species, including protons.
The particle identification process will be covered in more detail in \citesec{sec:hptpc_beam_flux:methods}.
One can see from \citefig{fig:unmoderatedBeam}, right, that even at this momentum setting there is a negligible flux of protons with kinetic energies of less than \SI{0.1}{\giga\electronvolt}.

  \caption[Time of flight spectrum and proton kinetic energy for the unmoderated and unbent T10 beam]{Left: time of flight spectrum of the unmoderated and unbent CERN T10 beam across a baseline of \SI{10.8}{\metre}. Right: measured kinetic energies of protons in the unmoderated and unbent CERN T10 beam.}
  \label{fig:unmoderatedBeam}
\end{figure}

It is necessary to modify the T10 beam for several reasons, one of them being the lack of the low energy protons.
Additionally, it is important to reduce the multiplicity of particles entering the HPgTPC due to the speed of the optical readout which could otherwise become overwhelmed.
Finally, it is desirable to modify the proton-minimum ionising particle (MIP) ratio in order to isolate more particles which are of interest to a cross-section analysis.

Therefore, two modification are made to the beam flux in order to achieve these goals.
Firstly up to four \SI{10 x 10 x 10}{\cm} acrylic moderator blocks are placed in the beam.
These blocks have the effect of scattering the incident particles and reducing their energy.
Additionally, the HPgTPC is moved to an off-axis angle in order to maximise the ratio of protons to MIPs.
From previous GEANT~\cite{geant} simulations it is determined that the optimal off-axis angle for the HPgTPC is between \ang{2} and \ang{3}.

However, due to space constraints in the beam hall, the HPgTPC could not be moved this far off-axis.
Instead, the beam was steered approximately \ang{1} off its nominal axis to increase the angle between the beam and the HPgTPC.
A bird's-eye view diagram of the experimental setup, which shows the beam position relative to the HPgTPC, is shown in \citefig{fig:beamSetup}.

  \label{fig:beamSetup}
\end{figure}

The effectiveness of this off-axis technique was assessed using several timing points which were used to measure the particle species and energies upstream and downstream of the HPgTPC prototype.
These timing points are shown in \citefig{fig:beamSetup} and, from upstream to downstream, consist of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \SOne, a \SI{40 x 40 x 5}{\mm} plastic scintillator cross, described in \citesec{sec:hptpc_beam_flux:overview:s1s2};
    \item \STwo, a \SI{120 x 120 x 5}{\mm} plastic scintillator tile, used for coincidence measurements with \SOne, described in \citesec{sec:hptpc_beam_flux:overview:s1s2};
    \item \SThree, a large panel of plastic scintillator bars placed directly upstream of the TPC vessel, described in \citesec{sec:hptpc_beam_flux:overview:s3};
    \item \SFour, a large panel of plastic scintillator bars placed directly downstream of the HPgTPC, which is described in \citesec{sec:hptpc_beam_flux:overview:s4} (its characterisation is described in \citesec{sec:hptpc_dtof_characterisation}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Survey and coordinate system}
\label{sec:hptpc_beam_flux:overview:survey}

The distances to the various objects in the beamline from an origin point is measured by the CERN Survey, Mechatronics and Measurements (SMM) group to a precision of \SI{0.5}{\mm}.
Specifically, multiple points on each of \SOne, \STwo, \SThree, \SFour and the HPgTPC prototype were measured.
From these measurements, the distance between various timing points is calculated and displayed in \citetab{tab:pointDistances}, calculated using this survey data

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \caption[Calculated distances between objects within the T10 beamline during the beam test]{Calculated distances between objects within the T10 beamline during the beam test}
  \label{tab:pointDistances}
  \begin{tabular}{c c}
    \hline
    \hline
    Points & Distance between centres / m \\
    \hline
    $\text{Beam monitor} - \SOne$ & \num{0.288(1)} \\
    $\SOne - \STwo$ & \num{1.419(1)} \\
    $\SOne - \SThree$ & \num{10.756(1)} \\
    $\SThree - \text{TPC US side}$ & \num{1.323(2)} \\
    $\text{TPC DS side} - \SFour$ & \num{0.918(2)} \\
    $\STwo - \SFour$ & \num{12.651(1)} \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The coordinate systeam used in this analysis is a right-handed coordinate system defined by the following directions: the $+\hat{z}$ direction is defined as the nominal beam axis, the $+\hat{y}$ direction is defined as vertically upwards and the $\hat{x}$ direction is defined as the horizontal direction which is perpendicular to the beam direction.
The origin is take to be at \SOne.
The $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{z}$ axes are labelled in \citefig{fig:beamSetup}.
In this analysis, the results are given in terms of the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$.
$\theta$ is measured in the $\hat{x}-\hat{z}$ plane with positive angle measured in the $+\hat{x}$ direction while $\phi$ is measured in the $\hat{y}-\hat{z}$ with positive angles measured in the $+\hat{y}$ direction.

\citefig{fig:angDistS1} shows the angular distribution of objects within the beamline as viewed from \SOne.
\citetab{tab:angDistS1} shows the angular extent of various beamline components as measured from \SOne.
Both of these use the data from the survey in order to calculate the results.

\subsection{The downstream time of flight detector (\SFour)}
\label{sec:hptpc_beam_flux:overview:s4}

The design of \SFour is primarily discussed in \citesec{sec:hptpc_dtof_characterisation:dtof}, however it will be briefly revisited here.
\SFour consists of 10 scintillator bars which together form an active area of \SI{1.40 x 0.78}{\metre}.
A diagram of one such bar is shown in \citefig{fig:barDiag}.
Each of these scintillator bars has a PMT attached to each end and these observe the scintillation light produced by charged particles traversing the bars.
A diagram of \SFour is shown in \citefig{fig:dtofDiag}.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:hptpc_beam_flux:methods}

In a beamline such as the T10 beamline at CERN, charged particles are selected using by momentum using a magnetic field.
This results in a beam of particles that are all of the same momentum but of different species.
Different particles of the same momentum will take different times to cover the same distance.
\citefig{fig:tofVsMom}, left and right, show the time of flight for various particles as a function of particle momentum for the $\SOne - \SThree$ and  $\STwo - \SFour$ distances respectively.
