\chapter{The ProtoDUNE Single Phase detector}
\label{sec:protodune}

The construction of the DUNE far detector represents a significant increase in scale for liquid argon time projection chambers (LAr TPCs).
Prior to the construction of ProtoDUNE Single Phase (ProtoDUNE-SP), the largest constructed LAr TPC was the ICARUS T600 detector~\cite{icarus}, originally operated at the INFN Gran Sasso Laboratory (LNGS).
This detector contained roughly \SI{600}{\tonne} of liquid argon in a single cryostat.
In comparison, each DUNE far detector module is expected to contain roughly \SI{17}{\kilo\tonne} of liquid argon.

The DUNE far detector modules will also also have significantly larger maximum drift distances than previously constructed LAr TPCs.
The maximum drift distance in a DUNE single-phase far detector module will be \SI{3.6}{\m} compared with a maximum drift distance in ICARUS T600 of \SI{1.5}{\m}.
This increased drift length necessitates an higher argon purity.

Additionally, the proposed lifetime of DUNE (over 15 years) and its relative inaccessibility (located as it is \SI{1.5}{\kilo\metre} underground) means that the detector technologies must be shown to have long term stability.
It is therefore necessary to complete extensive prototyping of the technologies used in the DUNE far detector prior to the construction of far detector modules.

To this end, two detectors are assembled at CERN to act as prototypes for the the DUNE far detector modules.
One of these modules is a single-phase LAr TPC while the other is a dual-phase LAr TPC.
The single-phase prototype is often termed ProtoDUNE-SP.

This prototype uses many of the components expected to be used in a DUNE FD module such as the Anode Plane Assemblies (see \citesec{sec:dune:fd:modules:singlephase}) expected to be used in the FD single-phase modules.
Furthermore, the drift distances in a single-phase DUNE FD

% Basic information
ProtoDUNE-SP consists of a membrane cryostat measuring with a cuboidal interior shape.
This cuboid measures \SI{7.9}{\m} in height and \SI{8.5}{\m} in the other two dimensions.
Within this cryostat, there are two time projection chambers measuring \SI{6.1}{\m} in height, \SI{3.6}{\m} in the drift direction and \SI{7.1}{\m} in the remaining direction.
These two time projection chambers are separated by a central cathode plane.
Together these TPCs contain an instrumented mass of \SI{419}{\tonne} of liquid argon.
Further details of the time projection chambers are given in \citesec{sec:protodune:tpc}.

The detector is exposed to charged particles in the momentum range \SIrange{0.3}{7}{\GeV\per\clight}~\cite{protodunePerformance}.
These particles are derived from a tertiary beam which then passes through the H4-VLE beam line where the particles are momentum selected.
This beam line contains a variety of instrumentation with which the particle species is determined.
More details of the beam and beam line are given in \citesec{sec:protodune:beam}.

A diagram of the detector with several key components labelled is shown in \citefig{fig:pdspDiag}.

\section{Time Projection Chamber}
\label{sec:protodune:tpc}

As detailed above and in \citesec{sec:dune:fd:modules:singlephase} each DUNE time projection chamber is formed from a cathode and an anode, across which a voltage is applied.
Similar to the plan for the DUNE FD single-phase modules, the cathode and anode are themselves made up of smaller units, the CPAs and APAs respectively.

Each anode plane is formed from three APAs each of which consists of a steel frame to which 4 wire planes are attached.
These wire planes are each separated from the following plane by a distance of \SI{4.79}{\mm}.
The wrapping scheme, which is the same as that planned for the DUNE FD modules, is shown in \citefig{fig:wireWrapping}.
From a drifting electron's point of view the first plane encountered is the ground (G) plane followed by the two induction planes (U and then V) which are all passed without the electron being captured.
Finally, the drift electron reaches the collection plane (X) where it is collected.
On either side of the APA, a bronze mesh is attached to act as a grounded shield plane for the wires.

In order to aid this collection on the final plane only, bias voltages are applied to the wire planes.
The voltages used are as follows: $V_{G} = \SI{-665}{\volt}$, $V_{U} = \SI{-370}{\volt}$, $V_{V} = \SI{0}{\volt}$ and $V_{X} = \SI{+820}{\volt}$~\cite{protodunePerformance}.

The cathode plane is formed from six CPAs, each \SI{6.1}{\m} in height and \SI{1.15}{\m} wide.
These CPAs are constructed from highly resistive materials which ensures that the do not rapidly discharge in the event of an electrical breakdown.
Such a discharge could damage the TPC electronics.

The cathode plane is biased at a voltage of \SI{-180}{\kilo\volt} which generates a field of \SI{500}{\volt\per\cm} across each drift volume.
This field is gradually stepped down in 60 steps by the field cage, thus ensuring that the field remains uniform between the anode and cathode plane.

This drift field results in a nominal electron drift velocity of \SI{1.59}{\mm\per\micro\second} which translates to a maximum drift time of \SI{2.25}{\micro\second}.

\section{Purity monitors}
\label{sec:protodune:prms}

ProtoDUNE-SP contains three purity monitors designed to provide independent measurements of the liquid argon purity.
These purity monitors were originally operated in the ICARUS T600 detector~\cite{icarus} and have since been refurbished.
A circuit diagram of a typical purity monitor used in liquid argon experiments is shown in \citefig{fig:prmDiag}.
