\section{Lifetime measurements}
\label{sec:pdune_calibration:lifetime}

In this chapter electron lifetime measurements from two sources are presented.
The first of these measurements comes from the purity monitors situation within the ProtoDUNE-SP cryostat (see \citesec{sec:protodune:prms}).

The second of these measurements utilises the high rate of cosmic rays impinging upon the detector.
These cosmic rays have a well known and roughly constant energy deposition before they stop.
This constant energy deposition means that they can be used as a `standard candle' throughout the TPC.
As a result, any observed changes in the energy deposition as a function of position within the detector must result from detector non-uniformities.
In particular, measured changes in the charge deposition as a function of drift distance can be used to measure the electron lifetime.

This measurement is attempted and presented in \citesec{sec:pdune_calibration:lifetime:selection}.

\subsection{Particle selection}
\label{sec:pdune_calibration:lifetime:selection}

In order to make an accurate measurement of the electron lifetime, it is important to ensure that that those cosmic ray tracks that are selected have the desired constant energy profile.
As shown in \citefig{fig:energyLoss}, as charged particles reach lower momenta their energy loss grows.
Therefore, it is desirable to only select those particles that are not in this region of rapidly changing energy deposition.
Specifically, it is desirable to only select those particles in the minimum ionising region of the energy loss profile.
