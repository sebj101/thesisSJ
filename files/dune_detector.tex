\chapter{The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment}
\label{ch:dune}

The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment currently under construction at two sites in the USA~(\cite{tdrVol1}, \cite{tdrVol2}, \cite{tdrVol3}, \cite{tdrVol4}).
The near detector site which will host the beam production facilities and the multi-component near detector is located at Fermilab, Illinois while the far detector site will be located at Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), South Dakota.
This will provide a baseline of approximately 1300~km.
A cartoon showing the arrangement of the detectors is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:duneCartoon}.

In this chapter, the DUNE detector will be discussed.
Section~\ref{sec:dune:overview} will provide an overview of the detector, its motivation and its physics goals.
Section~\ref{sec:dune:fd} will discuss the design of the far detector.
Section~\ref{sec:dune:nd} will discuss the design of the near detector and Section~\ref{sec:dune:beam} will discuss the design of the beam.

\section{Overview}
\label{sec:dune:overview}
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:history:currentState}, several questions remain in the field of neutrino oscillations.
Namely, the ordering of the neutrino mass eigenstates is not yet known and the value of $\delta_{CP}$ in the PMNS matrix remains unknown, which could imply that neutrinos violate Charge-Parity symmetry if it is proven that $\delta_{CP} \neq 0, \pi$.
Additionally, DUNE aims to be able to resolve the octant of $\theta_{23}$ (i.e. is $\theta_{23} > \pi/4$ or $< \pi/4$?) and usher in a new era of precision measurements of the PMNS matrix. 
DUNE aims to answer these questions, among others.

Due to the large volume of the far detector, it is also designed to observe neutrinos from a galactic core-collapse supernova if one should occur during the running time of the experiments.
This same large far detector mass will also allow it to search for certain Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) processes such as baryon number violation via proton decay.
A range of other BSM processes will also be explored by the experiment.

% Physics goals
% Oscillations first and foremost are the most important - refer to what is in the historical context chapter
DUNE aims to achieve its oscillation physics goals by simultaneously measuring the rates of $\nu_{\mu}$, $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$, $\nu_{e}$ and $\bar{\nu}_{e}$ interactions in the near and far detectors.
Enhanced fluxes of $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$ and $\bar{\nu}_{e}$ are achieved by changing the polarity of the focussing horns used to produced the beam (see Section~\ref{sec:dune:beam} for details).
In terms of terminology, the enhanced neutrino beam is produced using the Forward Horn Current (FHC) polarity while the the enhanced antineutrino beam is produced usign the Reverse Horn Current (RHC) polarity.
