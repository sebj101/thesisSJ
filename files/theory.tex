\label{sec:theory}

%%% Some explanation of what is in the chapter
This chapter will discuss the theory, history and current experimental knowledge of the neutrino and specifically the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations.
In \citesec{sec:theory:theory}, the theory of neutrino oscillations will be covered.
In \citesec{sec:theory:history}, a brief history of neutrino physics will be given, while in \citesec{sec:theory:currentState} there is a discussion of the current state of the neutrino mixing parameters.

\section{Theory}
\label{sec:theory:theory}

The Standard Model of particle physics currently provides our best description of physics at the fundamental level.
Within this model, there exist two types of fundamental particles: fermions (those particles which have half-integer values of `spin') and bosons (those particles which have integer values of `spin').
Neutrinos fall into the former category along with the other fundamental particles that make up everyday matter.
The fundamental bosons (apart from the Higgs) mediate interactions between the various particles.
Three fundamental forces are described by the Standard Model: the electromagnetic force (mediated by the photon), the strong force (mediated by the gluon) and the weak force (mediated by the \wpm and \zboson bosons).
The various particles of the Standard Model are shown in \citefig{fig:SMParticles}.
Here one can see that the fermions can be further divided into quarks (particles that feel the strong force) and leptons (those that do not).
One can see that neutrinos fall into the latter category.

	\label{fig:SMParticles}
\end{figure}

Additionally, neutrinos carry no electric or colour charge and therefore interact only via the weak force and gravity (the interaction with gravity is not described in the Standard Model).
Therefore in the Standard Model they may only interact with other fermions via the exchange of either a \wpm boson, in the case of charged current (CC) interactions, or a \zboson, in the case of neutral current (NC) interactions.
Examples of these interactions are shown in \citefig{fig:nuIntEx}.

Neutrinos exist in 3 flavours ($\nu_{e}$, $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\nu_{\tau}$), each corresponding to one of the charged leptons in the standard model.
These flavours are defined by the charged lepton produced by the neutrino when interacting in a charged current interaction.

The Standard Model describes the coupling of leptons to the \wboson boson with the Lagrangian
\begin{equation}
  \lagr_{W} = - \frac{g}{\sqrt{2}} \sum_{\substack{\alpha = e, \mu, \tau \\ i = 1, 2, 3}}
  \left( \overline{l_{L\alpha}} \gamma^{\lambda} U_{\alpha i} \nu_{Li} \wminus_{\lambda} +
  \overline{\nu_{Li}} \gamma^{\lambda} U^{*}_{\alpha i} l_{L\alpha} \wplus_{\lambda} \right) \, ,
  \label{eq:lagr}
\end{equation}
where a subscripted $L$ refers to a left-handed chiral projection, $l_{\alpha}$ are charged leptons of flavour $\alpha$, $\nu_{i}$ are mass eigenstates, $g$ is the semiweak coupling constant and $U$ is the lepton mixing matrix.

Here we will assume that $U$ is a unitary $3 \times 3$ matrix (and that there are therefore only 3 ``active'' neutrino flavours (neutrinos that couple to the $W$ and $Z$ bosons) and 3 neutrino mass eigenstates.
This matrix, also sometimes known as the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix, can be written as
\begin{equation}
  U =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    U_{e1}     & U_{e2}     & U_{e3} \\
    U_{\mu 1}  & U_{\mu 2}  & U_{\mu 3} \\
    U_{\tau 1} & U_{\tau 2} & U_{\tau 3}
  \end{pmatrix} \, .
\end{equation}
From the properties of unitary matrices it can be determined that a complex $N \times N$ matrix, contains at most $N^{2}$ independent parameters.
These are commonly represented as a combination of real mixing angles and complex phases.

It is possible to reduce the number of physically meaningful parameters further by redefining the charge lepton states in the manner $\bra{l_{\alpha}} \rightarrow \bra{l_{\alpha}'} = \bra{l_{\alpha}} e^{-i\phi_{\alpha}}$ which does not affect the physics.
Each of the $N$ charged lepton states may be redefined in this fashion, resulting in the removal of $N$ physically meaningful parameters~\cite{kayser2008neutrino}.
Therefore $U$ has $N(N-1)$ physically meaningful parameters of which $N(N-1)/2$ are real ``mixing angles'' while the remainder are complex phases.

As a result, $U$ can be represented as the following product of matrices:
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
  U &=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0       & 0 \\
    0 & c_{23}  & s_{23} \\
    0 & -s_{23} & c_{23}  
  \end{pmatrix}
  \times
  \begin{pmatrix}
    c_{13}             & 0 & s_{13}e^{-i\delta} \\
    0                  & 1 & 0 \\
    -s_{13}e^{i\delta} & 0 & c_{13}
  \end{pmatrix}
  \times
  \begin{pmatrix}
    c_{12}  & s_{12} & 0 \\
    -s_{12} & c_{12} & 0 \\
    0       & 0      & 1
  \end{pmatrix}
  \\
  &\times
  \begin{pmatrix}
    e^{i\omega_{1}/2} & 0                 & 0 \\
    0                 & e^{i\omega_{2}/2} & 0 \\
    0                 & 0                 & 1
  \end{pmatrix} \, ,
\end{split}
\end{align}
where $c_{ij} \equiv \cthetai{ij}$, $s_{ij} \equiv \sthetai{ij}$ and $\thetai{13}$, $\thetai{12}$, $\thetai{23}$ are the mixing angles.
The complex phases here are $\delta$, $\omega_{1}$ and $\omega_{2}$.

Unlike the other fermions it is possible that neutrinos may be their own antiparticles, due to their lack of electric charge.
In this case, neutrinos would be termed Majorana particles (in the case that neutrinos are not their own antiparticles they are referred to as Dirac particles).
In the case that $\overline{\nu}_{i} \neq \nu_{i}$ it is possible to redefine the $\nu_{i}$ such that $\delta$ is the only remaining physically significant complex phase~\cite{cpvMajorana}.
In this case it is possible to write $U$ as
\begin{equation}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    c_{12}c_{13} & s_{12}c_{13} & s_{13} e^{-i\delta} \\
    -s_{12}c_{23}-c_{12}s_{23}s_{13}e^{i\delta} & c_{12}c_{23}-s_{12}s_{23}s_{13}e^{i\delta} & s_{23}c_{13} \\
    s_{12}s_{23}-c_{12}c_{23}s_{13}e^{i\delta} & -c_{12}s_{23}-s_{12}c_{23}s_{13}e^{i\delta} & c_{23}c_{13} 
  \end{pmatrix} \, .
\end{equation}
Thus the angles can be expressed in terms of the elements of the mixing matrix in the following way~\cite{pdg2018}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
  \csthetai{12} = \frac{|U_{e1}|^{2}}{1 - |U_{e3}|^{2}}, \quad \ssthetai{12} = \frac{|U_{e2}|^{2}}{1 - |U_{e3}|^{2}}, \\
  \ssthetai{13} = |U_{e3}|^{2}, \quad \ssthetai{23} = \frac{|U_{\mu 3}|^{2}}{1 - |U_{e3}|^{2}}, \\
  \csthetai{23} = \frac{|U_{\tau 3}|^{2}}{1 - |U_{e3}|^{2}} \, .
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

From \citeeq{eq:lagr} we can see that the amplitude for the decay $\wplus \rightarrow \overline{l_{\alpha}} + \nu_{i}$ is proportional to the matrix element $U_{\alpha i}^{*}$.
If we then define the neutrino of flavour $\alpha$ (where $\alpha = e, \mu, \tau$) to be the state produced with a charged lepton $\overline{l_{\alpha}}$ we find that,
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\nu_{\alpha}} = \sum_{i=1}^{3} U^{*}_{\alpha i} \ket{\nu_{i}} \, .
\end{equation}
This can be inverted to give the mass eigenstate in terms of the flavour states
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\nu_{i}} = \sum_{\alpha=e, \mu, \tau} U_{\alpha i} \ket{\nu_{\alpha}} \, ,
\end{equation}
where the fractional flavour content of the state is $|U_{\alpha i}|^{2}$.

We then consider this neutrino interacting and producing some lepton $l_{\beta}$.
From \citeeq{eq:lagr}, we can see that the amplitude for this process is proportional to
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=1}^{3} U_{\beta i}U_{\alpha i}^{*} = \delta_{\beta \alpha}
\end{equation}
where the unitarity of $U$ has been used.
Here we can see that if a neutrino is produced with an associated lepton of flavour $\alpha$ and this neutrino interacts to produce a charged lepton, this charged lepton must also be of flavour $\alpha$.

\subsubsection{Vacuum oscillation case}

Let us now calculate the interaction probability for a neutrino that is created as flavour $\alpha$ and then interacts, after propagating a distance $L$, as though it is a neutrino of flavour $\beta$.
If $\alpha \neq \beta$, the neutrino has oscillated.

The amplitude of this reaction can be visualised using \citefig{fig:oscillationDiag1}.
Here a neutrino of flavour $\alpha$ is initially produced along with a charged lepton $\overline{l_{\alpha}}$.
The neutrino then propagates some distance $L$ before interacting in a target, resulting in the emission of charged lepton $l_{\beta}$

If we choose to move to the mass eigenstate basis, in order to calculate the amplitude we must now sum over the various mass eigenstates.
The diagram for the propagation of the mass eigenstate $\nu_{i}$ is shown in \citefig{fig:oscillationDiag2}.
As mentioned above, the amplitude for a neutrino of mass eigenstate $i$ to be produced in association with a lepton $\overline{l_{\alpha}}$ is given by $U_{\alpha i}^{*}$.
Upon reaching the target and interacting, the amplitude for the state $\nu_{i}$ to produce a lepton $l_{\beta}$ is given $U_{\beta i}$.

  \label{fig:oscillationDiag2}
\end{figure}

The final factor that must be taken into consideration in order to calculate this amplitude is the mass eigenstate propagator $\text{Prop}(\nu_{i})$.
From quantum mechanics, this can be given as $e^{-i \lambda \tau}$ where $\lambda = m - i \Gamma /2$ where $m$ is the mass of the particle, $\Gamma$ is the width of the particle and $\tau$ is the proper time that elapses for the particle in its rest frame during propagation. 
Here we assume that neutrinos are stable and therefore, that $\Gamma = 0$ to find
\begin{equation}
  \text{Prop}(\nu_{i}) = e^{-i m_{i} \tau_{i}} \, .
\end{equation}
Using Lorentz invariance, we can transform to the lab frame to find
\begin{equation}
  \text{Prop}(\nu_{i}) = e^{-i (E_{i}t - p_{i}L) } \, 
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the lab frame distance of propagation and $E_{i}$ and $p_{i}$ are the lab frame energy and momentum respectively.

The amplitude for the oscillation process, $\text{Amp}(\nu_{\alpha} \rightarrow \nu_{\beta})$ can therefore be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \text{Amp}(\nu_{\alpha} \rightarrow \nu_{\beta}) = \sum_{i=1}^{3} U^{*}_{\alpha i} e^{-i (E_{i}t - p_{i}L) } U_{\beta i}
  \label{eq:oscAmp}
\end{equation}
and the probability of oscillation, $\text{P}(\nu_{\alpha} \rightarrow \nu_{\beta})$ is just $|\text{Amp}(\nu_{\alpha} \rightarrow \nu_{\beta})|^{2}$.

We can see from the above that $\text{P}(\nu_{\alpha} \rightarrow \nu_{\beta})$ will depend on the phase differences between the propagators.
Therefore, we can express the phase difference between two neutrino mass eigenstates $i$ and $j$ in the pion rest frame as
\begin{equation}
  m_{i}\tau_{i} - m_{j}\tau_{j} = \left( E_{i} - E_{j} \right)t - \left( p_{i} - p_{j} \right) L_{0}  =  \left[ \left( E_{i} - E_{j} \right) - \left( p_{i} - p_{j} \right) \right]L_{0}
  \label{eq:phaseDiff}
\end{equation}
where in the last part we have used the ultrarelativistic nature of neutrinos to take $t=L_{0}$.
Now we must determine the values of $E_{i} - E_{j}$ and $p_{i} - p_{j}$.

In order to do this, consider the production of a neutrino and a muon from pion decay in the rest frame of the pion.
Here, for a given neutrino mass, $m_{i}^{\nu}$ the energy of the produced neutrino will be
\begin{equation}
  E^{\nu} = \frac{ (m^{\pi})^{2} + (m^{\nu})^{2} - (m^{\mu})^{2} }{ 2m^{\pi} }
\end{equation}
where the superscripts indicate the masses of each particle.
Therefore, we can now calculate the difference in energy for two different neutrinos, $\nu_{i}$ and $\nu_{j}$ to find
\begin{equation}
  E^{\nu}_{i} - E^{\nu}_{j} = \frac{ m_{i}^{\nu} - m_{j}^{\nu} }{ 2m^{\pi} } = \frac{\Delta m_{ij}^{2}}{2m^{\pi}} \, .
  \label{eq:nuDeltaE}
\end{equation}

Furthermore, the momentum for a neutrino of mass $m^{\nu}$ can be written as $(p^{\nu})^{2} = (E^{\nu})^{2} - (m^{\nu})^{2}$.
From here one can then find that
\begin{equation}
  \frac{ dp^{\nu} }{ d[(m^{\nu})^{2}] } = \frac{ 1 }{ 2p^{\nu} } \left[ \frac{ E^{\nu}}{ m^{\pi} } - 1 \right] \, .
\end{equation}
If we then take $m^{\nu} = 0$ and define $E_{0}^{\nu} = [(m^{\pi})^{2} - (m^{\mu})^{2}]/2m^{\pi}$ and $E_{0}^{\mu} = m^{\pi} - E_{0}^{\nu}$ as the energies of the neutrino and muon in the pion rest frame, assuming a massless neutrino, we find
\begin{equation}
  \frac{ dp^{\nu} }{ d[(m^{\nu})^{2}] }\bigg|_{m^{\nu}=0} = -\frac{ E^{\mu}_{0} }{ 2E^{\nu}_{0}m^{\pi} } \, .
\end{equation}

Therefore, to lowest order we find that the difference in momentum between the neutrino mass eigenstates is
\begin{equation}
  p_{i} - p_{j} = -\frac{ E^{\mu}_{0} \Delta m_{ij}^{2} }{ 2E^{\nu}_{0}m^{\pi} } \, 
\end{equation}
which can then be inserted, along with \citeeq{eq:nuDeltaE} into \citeeq{eq:phaseDiff} to give
\begin{equation}
  m_{i}\tau_{i} - m_{j}\tau_{j} = \frac{ \Delta m_{ij}^{2} }{ 2m^{\pi} }\left(1 + \frac{ E_{0}^{\mu} }{ E_{0}^{\nu} } \right) = \Delta m_{ij}^{2} \frac{L_{0}}{2E_{0}^{\nu}} \, .
\end{equation}

We can therefore insert this into the neutrino propagation amplitude of \citeeq{eq:oscAmp} to get
\begin{equation}
  \text{Amp}(\nu_{\alpha} \rightarrow \nu_{\beta}) = \sum_{i=1}^{3} U_{\alpha i}^{*} e^{ -i(m_{i}^{\nu})^{2}\frac{L_{0}}{2E^{\nu}_{0}} } U_{\beta i} \, .
\end{equation}
However, this amplitude is expressed in the rest frame variables of a decaying pion rather than the desired lab frame variables.
Both energy and length transform in the same manner under Lorentz transformations
\begin{align}
  L &= \gamma (1 + \beta) L_{0} \\
  E &= \gamma (1 + \beta) E_{0}
\end{align}
which means that we may write
\begin{equation}
\frac{L}{E} = \frac{L_{0}}{E_{0}^{\nu}} \, .
\end{equation}
In turn this allows us to write our oscillation amplitude as
\begin{equation}
  \text{Amp}(\nu_{\alpha} \rightarrow \nu_{\beta}) = \sum_{i=1}^{3} U_{\alpha i}^{*} e^{ -i(m_{i}^{\nu})^{2}\frac{L}{2E} } U_{\beta i} \, .
\end{equation}
This can then be used to write the oscillation probability as
\begin{align}
  \text{P}(\nu_{\alpha} \rightarrow \nu_{\beta}) &= | \text{Amp}(\nu_{\alpha} \rightarrow \nu_{\beta}) |^{2} \nonumber \\
  &= \delta_{\alpha \beta} - 4 \sum_{i > j} \text{Re}( U^{*}_{\alpha i} U_{\beta i} U_{\alpha j} U^{*}_{\beta j} ) \sin^{2}(\deltami{ij}L/4E) \nonumber \\
  & + 2 \sum_{i>j} \text{Im}( U^{*}_{\alpha i} U_{\beta i} U_{\alpha j} U^{*}_{\beta j} ) \sin (\deltami{ij}L/2E) \, .
  \label{eq:oscProbAllOut}
\end{align}

What does \citeeq{eq:oscProbAllOut} tell us about neutrino oscillations?
We can see that two conditions must be present in order for oscillations to be observed.
Firstly, there must be mass differences between the various mass eigenstates which tells us that neutrinos have non-zero mass.
Secondly, we must be non-trivial mixing between the lepton generations.
That is to say, $U$ cannot be diagonal if neutrino oscillations are observed.
Additionally, we see that neutrino oscillations can only tell us about the relative difference in neutrino mass eigenstates, they cannot tell us the absolute values of the mass eigenstates.

The phase difference $\deltami{ij}L/4E$ defines the length and energy scales at which oscillations come into play.
If we reinsert the missing factors of $\hbar$ and $c$ we find
\begin{equation}
  \frac{ \deltami{ij} L }{ 4E } = 1.27 \frac{ \deltami{ij} [\si{\electronvolt}]^{2} L [\si{\kilo\metre}]}{ E [\si{\giga\electronvolt}] } \, .
  \label{eq:phaseDiffM2}
\end{equation}
For example, consider a \SI{1}{\giga\electronvolt} atmospheric neutrino travelling the diameter of the Earth (approximately \SI{12000}{\kilo\metre}).
The effects of oscillations will be visible if \citeeq{eq:phaseDiffM2} is $\geq \order{1}$.
Therefore, such an experiment can probe mass splittings down to the level of around \SI{7d-5}{\electronvolt\squared}.

\citeeq{eq:oscProbAllOut} shows the oscillation probability for neutrinos only.
For antineutrinos the equivalent probability is written as
\begin{align}
  \text{P}(\overline{\nu}_{\alpha} \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_{\beta}) &= | \text{Amp}(\nu_{\alpha} \rightarrow \nu_{\beta}) |^{2} \nonumber \\
  &= \delta_{\alpha \beta} - 4 \sum_{i > j} \text{Re}( U^{*}_{\alpha i} U_{\beta i} U_{\alpha j} U^{*}_{\beta j} ) \sin^{2}(\deltami{ij}L/4E) \nonumber \\
  & - 2 \sum_{i>j} \text{Im}( U^{*}_{\alpha i} U_{\beta i} U_{\alpha j} U^{*}_{\beta j} ) \sin (\deltami{ij}L/2E) \, .
\end{align}
Thus we can see that, in order for $\text{P}(\nu_{\alpha} \rightarrow \nu_{\beta}) \neq \text{P}(\overline{\nu}_{\alpha} \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_{\beta})$, $U$ cannot be real.
Given that the process $\overline{\nu}_{\alpha} \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_{\beta}$ is the Charge-Parity (CP) mirror of $\nu_{\alpha} \rightarrow \nu_{\beta}$, if $\text{P}(\nu_{\alpha} \rightarrow \nu_{\beta}) \neq \text{P}(\overline{\nu}_{\alpha} \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_{\beta})$ then we have CP-violation in the lepton sector.

We can define the CP-violating difference for two flavours, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, as
\begin{equation}
  \Delta_{\alpha \beta} = \text{P}(\nu_{\alpha} \rightarrow \nu_{\beta}) - \text{P}(\overline{\nu}_{\alpha} \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_{\beta}) \, .
  \label{eq:cpViolation}
\end{equation}
Under Charge-Parity-Time (CPT) transformation, the process $\nu_{\alpha} \rightarrow \nu_{\beta}$ becomes $\overline{\nu}_{\beta} \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_{\alpha}$.
If CPT invariance holds then the probability of these two processes should be equal.
Using this fact we can rewrite \citeeq{eq:cpViolation} as
\begin{equation}
  \Delta_{\alpha \beta} = \text{P}(\overline{\nu}_{\beta} \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_{\alpha}) - \text{P}(\nu_{\beta} \rightarrow \nu_{\alpha}) = -\Delta_{\beta \alpha} \, .
\end{equation}
From the above, one can see that $\Delta_{\alpha \alpha} = 0$.
Thus one cannot observe CP violating differences by making so-called `disappearance' measurements.
  
\subsubsection{Two neutrino case}
\label{sec:theory:theory:twoNeutrino}

The consequences of this are more easily understood in the situation where only two neutrinos participate in the mixing.
In this case, the neutrino mixing matrix, $U$ can be written as a simple rotation matrix with one mixing angle, $\theta$,
\begin{equation}
  U =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos\theta  & \sin\theta \\
    -\sin\theta & \cos\theta
  \end{pmatrix} \, .
\end{equation}
Using this and \citeeq{eq:oscProbAllOut}, we find that
\begin{equation}
  \text{P}(\nu_{\alpha}\rightarrow\nu_{\beta}) = \sstwothetai{} \sin^{2} \left(\frac{\deltami{} L}{4E} \right) \, ,
\end{equation}
for $\alpha \neq \beta$ where \deltami{} is the mass difference between the mass eigenstates.
Restoring factors of $\hbar$ and $c$, this becomes
\begin{equation}
  \text{P}(\nu_{\alpha}\rightarrow\nu_{\beta}) = \sstwothetai{} \sin^{2} \left( 1.27 \frac{\deltami{} \left[\si{\eV\squared}\right] L [\si{\kilo\metre}]}{E\left[\si{\GeV}\right]} \right) \, .
  \label{eq:twoNuProb}
\end{equation}

One can visualise the effect of this equation graphically as is shown in \citefig{fig:twoNeutrino}. 
In this case we take $\deltami{} = 2.5 \times 10^{-3}~\text{eV}^{2}$ and $\thetai{} = 50^{\circ}$.
The length at which the first oscillation maximum occurs can be found by setting $1.27 \frac{\deltami{}L}{E} = \frac{\pi}{2}$ and rearranging for $L$ to give
\begin{equation}
  L_{\text{osc}} = \frac{E \pi}{2.54 \deltami{}} \, .
\end{equation}
Similarly, the energy at which the oscillation maximum occurs for a given baseline can be found by setting $1.27 \frac{\deltami{}L}{E} = \frac{\pi}{2}$ and rearranging to give
\begin{equation}
  E_{\text{osc}} = 2.54 \frac{\deltami{} L}{\pi} \,
\end{equation}
where the same units are used as in \citeeq{eq:twoNuProb}.
One can see that the strength of the oscillations is controlled by \sstwothetai{} while the period of the oscillations is controlled by \deltami{}.

\subsubsection{The MSW effect}
\label{sec:theory:theory:msw}
So far, only neutrino oscillations in a vacuum have been discussed.
The reason for the omission is the existence of the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) effect, which affects neutrino oscillations when passing through matter with non-zero electron density.

In order to explain this better, we return to the two neutrino case of Section~\ref{sec:theory:theory:twoNeutrino}.
Here we will denote the two flavour eigenstates as \nue and $\nu_{x}$.
The flavour of $\nu_{x}$ is not important, only that it is not an electron neutrino.
We know that the mass eigenstates which make up these states satisfy the Schr\"odinger equation in the form
\begin{align}
  i \frac{d}{dt}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \nu_{1} \\
    \nu_{2}
  \end{pmatrix}
  &=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    E_{1} & 0 \\
    0     & E_{2}
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \nu_{1} \\
    \nu_{2}
  \end{pmatrix} \\
  & \approx
  \begin{pmatrix}
    m_{1}^{2}/2E & 0 \\
    0 & m_{2}^{2}/2E
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \nu_{1} \\
    \nu_{2}
  \end{pmatrix}
  +
  \begin{pmatrix}
    E & 0 \\
    0 & E 
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \nu_{1} \\
    \nu_{2}
  \end{pmatrix} \, .  
\end{align}
Using the relation for the flavour eigenstates
\begin{equation}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \nue \\
    \nu_{x}
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
    -\sin\theta & \cos\theta
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \nu_{1} \\
    \nu_{2}
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
we can derive the Schr\"odinger equation for the flavour eigenstates in a vacuum,
\begin{align}
  i \frac{d}{dt}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \nue \\ \nu_{x}
  \end{pmatrix}
  &=
  \left( \frac{\deltami{}}{4E} \right)
  \begin{pmatrix}
    -\cos 2\theta & \sin 2\theta \\
    \sin 2\theta & \cos 2\theta
  \end{pmatrix} \\
  &=
  H_{V}
  \begin{pmatrix} \nue \\ \nu_{x} \end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
where $H_{V}$ represents the vacuum Hamiltonian.

In a dense medium the Hamiltonian changes due to the prescence of electrons in said medium.
Electron neutrinos and antineutrinos can scatter elastically from electrons via both charged and neutral current interactions.
Neutrino flavours other than electron can only scatter elastically from electrons via neutral currents.
Example diagrams of these interactions are shown in \citefig{fig:coherentScattering}.
\citefig{fig:coherentScattering:nue} and \citefig{fig:coherentScattering:anue} show interactions that are only possible for electron neutrinos and antineutrinos respectively, while \citefig{fig:coherentScattering:nul} shows an interaction which is possible for neutrinos of any flavour.

  \label{fig:coherentScattering}
\end{figure}

As a result, electron neutrinos and antineutrinos experience an additional potential, $V_{e} = \pm \sqrt{2} G_{F} N_{e}$, where $G_{F}$ is the Fermi constant, $N_{e}$ is the electron density of the medium and the negative sign applies for antineutrinos.
This results in the Hamiltonian, which we term $H_{M}$, now containing an additional term so it can now be written as
\begin{equation}
  H_{M} =  \left( \frac{\deltami{}}{4E} \right)
  \begin{pmatrix}
    -\cos 2\theta & \sin 2\theta \\
    \sin 2\theta & \cos 2\theta
  \end{pmatrix}
  +
  \begin{pmatrix}
    V_{e} & 0 \\
    0 & 0
  \end{pmatrix} \, .
\end{equation}

We can subtract $\frac{V_{e}}{2} I$ (where $I$ is the identity matrix) from $H_{M}$ to give
\begin{equation}
  H_{M} = \left( \frac{\deltami{}}{4E} \right)
  \begin{pmatrix}
    -\cos\theta+A & \sin 2\theta \\
    \sin 2\theta & \cos 2\theta - A 
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  A = \pm \frac{ 2\sqrt{2}G_{F}N_{e}E }{\deltami{}} \, .
\end{equation}

We can now redefine $H_{M}$ in terms of an `effective' mass splitting and mixing angle (\deltami{m} and $\theta_{m}$ respectively) so that it becomes
\begin{equation}
  H_{M} = \left( \frac{\deltami{m}}{4E} \right)
  \begin{pmatrix}
    -\cos 2\theta_{m} & \sin 2\theta_{m} \\
    \sin 2\theta_{m} & \cos 2\theta_{m}
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
which one can observe is the same form as $H_{V}$.
This leads to an oscillation probability of the same form as \citeeq{eq:twoNuProb}
\begin{equation}
  P(\nue \rightarrow \nu_{x}) = \sin^{2} 2\theta_{m} \sin^{2} \left( \frac{\deltami{m} L}{4E} \right) \, .
\end{equation}

We can derive expressions for these `effective' mixing parameters and find that
\begin{align}
  \deltami{m} &= \deltami{} \sqrt{ (\cos 2\theta - A)^{2} + \sin^{2} 2\theta }  \label{eq:mswMass} \\
  \sin 2\theta_{m} &= \frac{\sin 2\theta}{\sqrt{ (\cos 2\theta - A)^{2} + \sin^{2} 2\theta }} \, . \label{eq:mswAngle}
\end{align}
Thus we can see that these matter effects have an effect on both the period and strength of oscillations.
Additionally we can also see that, due to the sign change of $A$ for antineutrinos, the opposite effect will occur for neutrinos and antineutrinos. 

One can infer several interesting points from \citeeq{eq:mswMass} and \citeeq{eq:mswAngle}.
Firstly, long baselines or high matter densities are required to observe matter effects.
If neither of these are present, the oscillation probabilities tend to the vacuum oscillation case.
This is illustrated in \citefig{fig:twoNuMSW} which shows the appearance probability of $\nu_{x}$ as a function of neutrino energy for multiple baselines, with and without matter effects.
Here, it can clearly be seen that the appearance probability is changed far more at longer baselines.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{adjustbox}{max totalsize={.6\textwidth}, center}
    \input{files/figures/theory/twoNuMSWComp}
  \end{adjustbox}
  \caption[Two neutrino appearance probabilities with and without matter effects.]{$\nu_{x}$ appearance probability at multiple fixed baselines, with and without matter effects. Here, $\rho_{e} = 8.5 \times 10^{25}~\text{m}^{-3}$, $\thetai{} = 50^{\circ}$ and $\deltami{} = 2.5 \times 10^{-3}~\text{eV}^{2}$.}
  \label{fig:twoNuMSW}
\end{figure}

Additionally, under the condition that
\begin{equation}
  \cos 2\theta = \frac{2 \sqrt{2} G_{F} N_{e} E}{\deltami{}}
\end{equation}
we can see that $\stwothetai{m} = 1$, i.e. maximal oscillations can occur regardless of the value of the vacuum mixing angle.
This effect is known as the MSW resonance.
We can also observe that as $A \rightarrow \infty$ (in extremely high matter densities, for example), $\sin 2\theta_{m} \rightarrow 0$ meaning that no oscillations occur.
Additionally, it can be observed that $A$ depends on the sign of \deltami{}.
Thus, the MSW effect can be used to determine the sign of the mass differences.

\subsubsection{Three neutrino oscillations}
\label{sec:theory:theory:threeNeutrino}

For three flavours of neutrino, the oscillation probabilities become significantly more complicated.
However, a few illustrative oscillation probabilities or relevant approximations are noted here.
In the three neutrino case, the parameters governing the oscillations are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The mixing angles of the PMNS matrix, \thetai{12}, \thetai{13}, \thetai{23}
\item The mass splittings, \deltami{21}, \deltami{31}
\item The CP-violating phase of the PMNS matrix, \dcp
\end{itemize}
where \deltami{21} and \deltami{31} is one way to parametrise the differences between the 3 different mass states.

Note that, in a vacuum, the oscillation frequency does not depend upon the sign of the mass splittings, only the absolute value.
At the present time, the ordering of the mass eigenstates is not known.
That is to say, it is not known whether $\nu_{3}$ is the heaviest or the lightest mass eigenstate.
However, the sign of \deltami{21} is known.

The scenario in which $\nu_{3}$ is the heaviest mass eigenstate is referred to as the `normal' hierarchy while the scenario in which $\nu_{3}$ is the lightest mass eigenstate is referred to as the `inverted' hierarchy.
The choice of nomenclature derives from the flavour content of the mass eigenstates, where $\nu_{1}$ has the greatest $\nu_{e}$ component and $\nu_{3}$ has the lowest.
Thus the `normal' hierarchy somewhat mirrors the charged lepton masses, with the most `electron-like' mass eigenstate being the lightest~\cite{massHierarchy}.
The two different mass hierarchies are illustrated in \citefig{fig:massHierarchy}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{files/figures/theory/mh}
  \caption[Diagram of neutrino mass hierarchies.]{Figure illustrating the two different neutrino mass hierarchies along with the fractional flavour content of the mass eigenstates according to global best fit values. The variation from the bottom of the bands to the top is the variation induced by varying $\dcp$ from 0 to $\pi$. Figure from~\cite{tdrVol2}.}
  \label{fig:massHierarchy}
\end{figure}

For all flavours the survival probability of a given neutrino flavour, the so-called ``disappearance'' channel, can be expressed as~\cite{Nunokawa_2008}
\begin{align}
  P(\nu_{\alpha} \rightarrow \nu_{\alpha}) &= P(\overline{\nu}_{\alpha} \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_{\alpha})\\
  &= 1 - 4|U_{\alpha 1}|^{2} |U_{\alpha 2}|^{2} \sin^{2} \Delta_{21} - 4 |U_{\alpha 2}|^{2} |U_{\alpha 3}|^{2} \sin^{2}\Delta_{32} \\ &- 4 |U_{\alpha 3}|^{2} |U_{\alpha 1}|^{2} \sin^{2} \Delta_{31}
\end{align}
where $\Delta_{ij}=\deltami{ij}L/4E$.
For muon neutrinos, a case which is particularly relevant to long baseline accelerator experiments, this can be approximated as~\cite{pdg2018}
\begin{align}
  P(\numu \rightarrow \numu) &\approx 1 - \sstwothetai{\mu\mu} \sin^{2}\left( \frac{\deltami{\mu\mu}L}{4E} \right) \\
  \label{eq:numuSurvival}
  &\approx 1-\csthetai{13}\sstwothetai{23}\sin^{2}\left( \frac{\deltami{32}L}{4E} \right) + \text{higher order terms}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  \ssthetai{\mu\mu} &= \csthetai{13}\ssthetai{23} \\
  \deltami{\mu\mu}  &= \ssthetai{12}\deltami{31}+\csthetai{12}\deltami{32} \\
  &+\cos\dcp\sthetai{13}\stwothetai{12}\tthetai{23}\deltami{21} \, .
\end{align}
and we have dropped higher order terms on the basis that $|\deltami{32}| \gg |\deltami{21}|$.

In the physics of long baseline neutrino oscillations, another crucial measurement is the oscillation of \numu into \nue and \anumu into \anue, commonly referred to as the appearance channel.
We find that, in a vacuum~\cite{Nunokawa_2008},
\begin{align}
  P(\numu \rightarrow \nue) &= \left| U^{*}_{\mu 3} e^{-im_{3}^{2}L/2E} U_{e3} + U^{*}_{\mu 2} e^{-im_{2}^{2}L/2E} U_{e2} + U^{*}_{\mu 1}e^{-im_{1}^{2}L/2E}U_{e1} \right|^{2} \\
  &= \left| 2U_{\mu 3}^{*}U_{e3} \sin \Delta_{31} e^{-i \Delta_{32}} + 2U^{*}_{\mu 2}U_{e2} \sin \Delta_{21} \right|^{2} \\
  & \approx \left| \sqrt{P_{\text{atm}}} e^{-i(\Delta_{32}+\dcp)} + \sqrt{P_{\text{sol}}} \right|^{2} \\
  &= P_{\text{atm}} + 2 \sqrt{P_{\text{atm}}} \sqrt{P_{\text{sol}}} \cos(\Delta_{32}+\dcp) + P_{\text{sol}}
  \label{eq:threeNuApp}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
  \sqrt{P_{\text{atm}}} &= \sthetaij{2}{3} \stwothetai{13} \sin\Delta_{31} \\
  \sqrt{P_{\text{sol}}} &= \cthetai{23} \cthetai{13} \stwothetai{12} \sin\Delta_{21} \, .
\end{align}
In the case of antineutrino oscillations, the sign of \dcp is flipped.

A graphical representation of these equations for multiple different values of \dcp is shown in \citefig{fig:threeNuApp}.
One can clearly see the significant effect that changing the value of \dcp has on the appearance probabilities of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos.

  \label{fig:threeNuApp}
\end{figure}

Now we turn to look at three neutrino oscillations in matter where we must take into account the matter effect.
Using the fact that $|\deltami{21}/\deltami{31}| \approx 0.03$ and that \thetai{13} is also small, the following approximations can be used~\cite{Nunokawa_2008} for long baseline oscillations:
\begin{align}
  \Delta m^{2}_{31, m} &\approx \deltami{31} - 2 \sqrt{2} G_{F} N_{e} E \\
  \Delta m^{2}_{21, m} &\approx - 2 \sqrt{2} G_{F} N_{e} E \\
  \Delta m^{2}_{32, m} &\approx \deltami{32}
\end{align}
which leads to $\sqrt{P_{\text{atm}}}$ and $\sqrt{P_{\text{atm}}}$ (see \citeeq{eq:threeNuApp}) becoming~\cite{Nunokawa_2008}
\begin{align}
  \sqrt{P_{\text{atm}}} &= \sthetai{23} \stwothetai{13} \frac{ \sin(\Delta_{31}-aL) }{ (\Delta_{31} - aL) } \Delta_{31} \\
  \sqrt{P_{\text{sol}}} &= \cthetai{23} \stwothetai{12} \frac{ \sin(aL) }{ aL } \Delta_{21}
\end{align}
where $a = G_{F}N_{e} / \sqrt{2}$.
Thus the probability of \nue appearance in a beam of \numu can be written
\begin{align}
  P(\numu \rightarrow \nue) &\approx \ssthetai{23} \sstwothetai{13} \frac{ \sin^{2}(\Delta_{31}-aL) }{ (\Delta_{31} - aL)^{2} } \Delta_{31}^{2} \\
  &+ \stwothetai{23} \stwothetai{13} \stwothetai{12} \frac{ \sin(\Delta_{31}-aL) }{ (\Delta_{31} - aL) } \\
  & \times \frac{ \sin(aL) }{aL} \Delta_{21} \cos(\Delta_{31} + \dcp) \\
  &+ \csthetai{23}\sstwothetai{12} \frac{ \sin^{2}(aL) }{(aL)^{2}} \Delta_{21}^{2} 
\end{align}
where we can make the substitutions $a \rightarrow -a$ and $\dcp \rightarrow -\dcp$ for the antineutrino case.

A graphical representation of the $\numu(\anumu) \rightarrow \nue(\anue)$ probability is shown in \citefig{fig:threeNuMatter} for a baseline of 1300~km in the crust of the Earth.
It can be seen at these baselines and matter densities that the true neutrino mass hierarchy has a significant effect on the electron neutrino and antineutrino appearance probabilities.

\section{A brief history of the neutrino}
\label{sec:theory:history}

\subsection{Direct detection of the neutrino}
\label{sec:theory:history:detection}

% Pauli's hypothesis of the neutrino
The existence of the neutrino as a particle carrying no electric charge was first hypothesised in 1930 by Wolfgang Pauli as a solution to issues observed in the spectrum produced by nuclear $\beta$-decay~\cite{pauliNeutrino}.
At the time, the existence of only 3 subatomic particles was known, the electron, the proton and the photon~\cite{ideaOfNeutrino}.
 
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{files/figures/theory/betaDecaySpectrum}
  \caption[Differential electron energy spectrum for the $\beta$-decay of tritium.]{Differential electron energy spectrum for the $\beta$-decay of tritium. The endpoint $E_{0}$ lies at 18.574~keV. Taken from~\cite{betaDecay}.}
  \label{fig:betaDecay}
\end{figure}

In contrast to $\alpha$- and $\gamma$-decay, the energy spectrum of the emitted particle in $\beta$-decay is observed to be continuous~\cite{ideaOfNeutrino} as shown in \citefig{fig:betaDecay}.
Given that $\beta$-decay appeared to be a two-body decay (as $\alpha$- and $\gamma$-decay are) of the form
\begin{equation}
  A \rightarrow B + \electron
\end{equation}
this seemed to violate the principle of conservation of energy.
For a two-body decay the emitted electron should be monochromatic with an energy of
\begin{equation}
  E = \left( \frac{m_{A}^{2} - m_{B}^{2} + m_{e}^{2}}{2 m_{A}} \right)c^{2} \, .
\end{equation}

To rectify this, Pauli proposed the existence of a neutral particle which escaped the nucleus without detection during $\beta$-decay.
He originally named this particle the ``neutron'', although this name would be used for the neutral baryon after its discovery by Chadwick in 1932~\cite{neutronDiscovery} and the neutrino would instead be known by its modern name.

We now know that an electron neutrino (antineutrino) is emitted during $\beta^{+}$- ($\beta^{-}$-) decay. The generic equation for $\beta^{-}$ decay of an atom is
\begin{equation}
  ^{A}_{Z}X~\rightarrow~^{A}_{Z+1}X' + e^{-} + \bar{\nu}_{e} \,,
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the mass number of the atom, and $Z$ is the atomic number. 

% Experimental discovery by Cowan and Reines
Experimental confirmation of the neutrino's existence came in 1956 where the reaction
\begin{equation}
  \bar{\nu}_{e} + p \rightarrow e^{+} + n
  \label{eq:cowanReines}
\end{equation}
was first observed at the Savannah River Plant, South Carolina. The experiment utilised the large neutrino flux from a nuclear reactor incident on the protons in a tank of water sandwiched between scintillation counters.
This water contained a solution of cadmium chloride which emits a photon upon neutron capture.
In the event of the reaction shown in eq.~(\ref{eq:cowanReines}), the outgoing positron would annihilate with an electron in the water, resulting in a prompt coincidence signal.
An additional check was made by requiring a delayed photon from the capture of the outgoing neutron~\cite{cowanReines}.

% Discovery of numu
Up to this point, only electron neutrinos had been observed (counterparts to the electron).
However in 1937 the muon, a heavier counterpart to the electron, was observed~\cite{muonDiscovery}.
In 1962 the existence of a neutrino corresponding to the muon was confirmed at Brookhaven Alternatng Gradient Synchrotron.
These muon neutrinos and antineutrinos ($\nu_{\mu}$ and $\bar{\nu}_{\mu}$) were produced by colliding a beam of protons with a beryllium target, producing charged pions and kaons.
These mesons subsequently decayed via the channels
\begin{align}
    K^{\pm} \rightarrow \mu^{\pm} + \nu_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu}) \\
    \pi^{\pm} \rightarrow \mu^{\pm} + \nu_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu})
\end{align}
to produce the desired neutrinos and antineutrinos.

The resulting neutrino interactions were then observed in a spark chamber.
Interactions arising from muon neutrinos and antineutrinos were identified by the prescence of one or more long tracks originating from within the fiducial volume of the detector at the same time as the beam pulse~\cite{numuDiscovery}.   

% C. S. Wu's discovery of neutrino helicity and parity violation?

% nutau discovery from DONUT
The discovery of the tau lepton in $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions in 1975~\cite{tauLepton} led to the theorisation of a corresponding neutrino, in keeping with the two already identified for the electron and muon leptons.
However, due to the high mass of the tau lepton ($1777~\text{MeV}/c^{2}$ compared to $0.5110~\text{MeV}/c^{2}$ and $105.7~\text{MeV}/c^{2}$ for the electron and muon respectively~\cite{pdg2018}) a higher energy beam was required for direct observation of the tau neutrino since the $K^{\pm}$ and $\pi^{\pm}$ mesons typically used in beam neutrino experiments did not have high enough masses to decay to a tau lepton-neutrino pair.

From 1997, the DONuT (Direct Observation of the Nu Tau) collaboration fired a beam of 800~GeV protons from the Tevatron into a tungsten alloy target.
Although this process produced many $\pi^{\pm}$ and $K^{\pm}$ mesons, the centre of mass energy was high enough in this case to produce significant numbers of $D_{s}$ mesons~\cite{donutFinal}.
These $D_{s}$ mesons decay leptonically to $\tau^{+}\nu_{\tau}$ with a branching fraction of 5.48\%~\cite{pdg2020}, producing a flux of tau neutrinos.
In 2000 the collaboration reported the observation of 4 tau neutrino charged current interactions with an estimated background of 0.34 events, thus confirming the tau neutrino's existence~\cite{tauNeutrino}.  

Since this discovery no evidence for further leptons, charged or neutral, has been observed.
Results from the LEP (Large Electron Positron) collider also indicate that the number of neutrino flavours is 3.
This result was inferred by observing the width of the $Z$ boson using $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions.
The width of the $Z$ boson, $\Gamma_{Z}$ is given as
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma_{Z} = \Gamma_{ee} + \Gamma_{\mu\mu} + \Gamma_{\tau\tau} + \Gamma_{\text{hadrons}} + N_{\nu}\Gamma_{\nu\nu}
\end{equation}
where the various terms are the partial decay widths of the $Z$ boson into various particles and $N_{\nu}$ is the number of neutrino flavours.
These partial decay widths can be calculated from Z-boson couplings and standard model parameters.
By precisely measuring both $m_{Z}$ and $\Gamma_{Z}$ it was determined that $N_{\nu} = 2.9840 \pm 0.0082$, confirming that only 3 flavours of neutrino exist for $m_{\nu} < m_{Z}/2$~\cite{zBosonWidth}.
One such plot showing combined measurements from the various LEP experiments is shown in \citefig{fig:zBosonWidth}, clearly showing the preference of the data for the three neutrino case.

\subsection{The solar neutrino problem and neutrino oscillations}
\label{sec:theory:history:oscillations}

% Solar neutrino problem and discovery of oscillations
At the same time as these various new particles were being discovered, anomalies were observed in the rate of neutrinos produced by the Sun, where a large flux of electron neutrinos is produced by nuclear fusion and the decay of the various fusion products. 
By the 1960s it became possible to detect some of these neutrinos.
Ray Davis's Homestake experiment first published measurements in 1968 which showed a large deficit in the number of detected neutrinos compared with theoretical predictions.

The detector consisted of a tank of 390,000 litres of tetrachloroethylene ($\text{C}_{2}\text{Cl}_{4}$), which equates to a mass of chlorine (the target nucleus) of 520 tons.
The detector was located in the Homestake gold mine at Lead, South Dakota.
The neutrinos were detected via the reaction
\begin{equation}
  \nu_{e} + ^{37}\text{Cl} \rightarrow e^{-} + ^{37}\text{Ar} \, .
\end{equation}
Following this, the argon was extracted from the tank and its radioactive decay measured thus giving a measurement of the number of electron neutrino interactions~\cite{rayDavis}.

However, this experiment was only sensitive to the electron neutrino flux and it was therefore not apparent that this deficit was caused by oscillations rather than mismodelling of the solar neutrino flux.
While anomalies in the number of detected neutrinos continued to be found throughout the 1980s, simultaneously reactor and accelerator neutrino experiments were unable to confirm the prescence of oscillations~\cite{neutrinoHistory}.

It wasn't until 1998 that confirmation of neutrino oscillations would come from the Super-Kamiokande experiment and their studies of atmospheric neutrinos.
Atmospheric neutrinos are primarily produced through the decays of particles produced by collisions of cosmic rays with nuclei in the atmosphere via the channel
\begin{equation}
  \pi^{\pm} \rightarrow \mu^{\pm} + \nu_{\mu}(\bar{\nu}_{\mu}) \, , 
\end{equation}
where the muon then decays via
\begin{equation}
  \mu^{\pm} \rightarrow e^{\pm} + \bar{\nu}_{\mu}(\nu_{\mu}) + \nu_{e}(\bar{\nu}_{e}) \, .
\end{equation}
This gives an expected ratio of the neutrino fluxes of
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\nu_{\mu} + \bar{\nu}_{\mu}}{\nu_{e} + \bar{\nu}_{e}} \approx 2
\end{equation}
where this ratio crucially does not rely on modelling in the same manner as predictions of solar neutrino rates.

The Super-Kamiokande detector consists of a 50~kton water Cherenkov detector which is instrumented with photomultiplier tubes (PMTs).
When neutrinos interact within the detector, the outgoing particles are identified by the Cherenkov light rings they produce.
The different characteristics of the rings produced by muons and electrons allow the identification of both muon and electron neutrino interactions.

The experiment found an asymmetry in the number of detected atmospheric muon neutrinos travelling up and down but no similar effect was observed for electron neutrinos.
This was thought to be caused by the different distances travelled by upwards- and downwards-going atmospheric neutrinos.
An atmospheric neutrino travelling vertically downwards travels a distance of roughly 15~km, while an atmospheric neutrino travelling vertically upwards travels a distance of roughly 13000~km.
This was taken to be evidence of muon neutrinos oscillating into tau neutrinos as they passed through the Earth~\cite{superK}.
Plots showing this asymmetry are shown in \citefig{fig:superKResults}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{files/figures/theory/superKResults}
  \caption[Super-Kamiokande atmospheric neutrino results as a function of zenith angle.]{Results from~\cite{superK} showing the number of electron and muon neutrino-like events as a function of cosine of the zenith angle, $\theta$.

The black line shows the expectation for the case where muon neutrinos oscillate into tau neutrinos. Various momentum ranges are shown separately. For multi-GeV muon neutrino-like events, fully contained and partially contained events are shown separately.}
  \label{fig:superKResults}
\end{figure}

Further strengthening the case for oscillations, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) published results in 2002 which analysed both the charged current and neutral current interactions of $^{8}\text{B}$ neutrinos produced in the Sun.
The detector consisted of 1~ktons of heavy water ($\text{D}_{2}\text{O}$) surrounded by inward facing PMTs which detected Cherenkov light produced by charged particles.

Neutral current events were observed via the reaction
\begin{equation}
  \nu_{x} + d \rightarrow p + n + \nu_{x} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $x = e, \mu, \tau$.
This reaction should occur equally often for all flavours of neutrinos.
These events were identified by observing the photons emitted during neutron capture on deuterons or, later in the experiment, $^{35}\text{Cl}$ atoms which were added in the form of NaCl.  

Charged current interactions of electron neutrinos were observed via the channel
\begin{equation}
  \nu_{e} + d \rightarrow p + p + e^{-} \, .
\end{equation}
It was not possible to detect the charged current interactions of muon or tau neutrinos due to the low energy of $^{8}\text{B}$ neutrinos.
These interactions were identified by the Cherenkov light produced by the emitted electron.

The results showed that the flux of solar electron neutrinos was approximately one third of the total flux and thus that some solar electron neutrinos had oscillated into different flavours~\cite{SNO}.
These observations of oscillations also confirmed the massive nature of neutrinos where they had once been believed to be massless.

Further confirmations of the existence of oscillations would come from reactor neutrino experiments (KamLAND in 2003~\cite{kamland2003}) and from long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments (K2K in 2003~\cite{k2kDisapp} and MINOS in 2006~\cite{minosDisapp}).

%%%% Current state of oscillations
\section{Current state of neutrino physics}
\label{sec:theory:currentState}

%%% Current state of PMNS matrix
%It is widely accepted today that the left-handed flavour neutrino flavour states are formed from linear combinations of the mass eigenstates in the relation
%\begin{equation}
%  \nu_{lL}(x) = \sum_{j=1}^{3} U_{lj} \nu_{jL}(x)
%\end{equation}
%where $l = e, \mu, \tau$ and $U$ is the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix.
%This unitary matrix is more commonly parameterised in terms of three mixing angles ($\theta_{12}, \theta_{13}, \theta_{23}$) and one complex phase, $\dcp$ as
%\begin{equation}
%  U =
%  \begin{bmatrix}
%    c_{12}c_{13} & s_{12}c_{13} & s_{13} e^{-i\dcp} \\
%    -s_{12}c_{23}-c_{12}s_{23}s_{13}e^{i\dcp} & c_{12}c_{23}-s_{12}s_{23}s_{13}e^{i\dcp} & s_{23}c_{13} \\
%    s_{12}s_{23}-c_{12}c_{23}s_{13}e^{i\dcp} & -c_{12}s_{23}-s_{12}c_{23}s_{13}e^{i\dcp} & c_{23}c_{13}
%  \end{bmatrix}
%\end{equation}
%where $s_{ij} = \text{sin}\theta_{ij}$, $c_{ij} = \text{cos}\theta_{ij}$, $\theta_{ij} = [0, \pi/2]$ and $\dcp = [0, 2\pi]$.
%These mixing angles control the strength of the oscillations while $\dcp$ specifies the difference in the oscillation of neutrinos and antineutrinos.
%The frequencies of the oscillations are controlled by the differences between the squares of the masses of the mass eigenstates, $\Delta m_{ij}^{2} = m_{i}^{2} - m_{j}^{2}$ where $i \neq j$.
%The two independent mass splittings which are usually referred to are $m^{2}_{21}$ and $m^{2}_{31}$~\cite{pdg2018}.

% Uncertainty on each of the various parameters
Today the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations is widely accepted. 
However, the values of the parameters involved in neutrino oscillation are yet to be precisely determined.
The most recent global fit of these parameters gives the values shown in \citetab{tab:nufit4}, along with the associated uncertainties, and shows that significant questions still exist in the field of neutrino oscillations.
\citefig{fig:nufit4Contours} shows the confidence limits obtained for the various parameters.

Given that the mass hierarchy is unknown and that $\deltami{21} \ll |\deltami{31}| \simeq |\deltami{32}|$, it is easier to express the larger mass splitting in terms that depend on the true mass hierarchy.
We denote this mass splitting as \deltami{3l} where
\begin{equation}
  \deltami{3l} =
  \begin{cases}
    \deltami{31} > 0 & \text{for NH} , \\
    \deltami{32} < 0 & \text{for IH} \, .
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\begin{table}

Although the absolute values of $\Delta m^{2}_{21}$ and $\Delta m^{2}_{31}$ have $\pm1\sigma$ uncertainties of less than 3\% and 2\% respectively, the sign of $\Delta m^{2}_{31}$ is not known, i.e. it is not known whether $\nu_{3}$ is the lightest or the heaviest mass eigenstate.

While the current global best fit disfavours the inverted hierarchy, the evidence is not conclusive.
The inverted hierarchy is disfavoured with $\Delta \chi^{2}=4.7$ ($\Delta \chi^{2}=9.3$ if Super-Kamiokande atmospheric data is included)~\cite{nufit4}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering

  \caption[Global 2-dimensional limits on oscillation parameters.]{Contours from~\cite{nufit4}.

The coloured regions show the contours without the Super-Kamiokande atmospheric data while the black lines show the limits with this data.}
  \label{fig:nufit4Contours}
\end{figure}

The global fit also shows that CP-conserving values of $\dcp$ are disfavoured but this preference is slight.
In fact $\sim72\%$ of $\dcp$ values fall within the $\pm3\sigma$ limits~\cite{nufit4}.
However, recent results from the Tokai to Kamioka (T2K) experiment show more stringent limits on the value of $\dcp$, excluding nearly $50\%$ of the values of $\dcp$ at $3\sigma$~\cite{t2kRecent}.
However, this result is not yet at the exacting standard of proof required in high energy physics and more work will be needed to confirm or disprove current hints about CP-violation and the neutrino mass hierarchy.

It is also hoped that the next generation of neutrino experiments will enable precision measurements of the mixing angles of the PMNS matrix, thus enabling tests of its unitarity.

\subsection{Measurement of \thetai{12} and \deltami{21}}
\label{sec:theory:currentState:solar}
%%% SNO, super K, borexino experiments

These parameters are often known as \thetai{\text{sol}} and \deltami{\text{sol}} due to their primary measurement using the solar neutrino flux.
The solar neutrino experiments setting the tightest constraints include the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO)~\cite{snoCombined}, Super-Kamiokande~\cite{superKReview} and Borexino~\cite{borexino} experiments.
Each of these experiments primarily detect \nue produced by $^{8}\text{B}$ decays, the spectra of which is shown in \citefig{fig:solarNuFluxes}.
Measurements of the oscillation parameters are made by comparing the measured neutrino fluxes with those predicted by solar models~\cite{solarModel} and then using this to constrain the oscillation parameters.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\linewidth]{files/figures/theory/solarNeutrinoSpectrum}
  \caption[Solar neutrino spectrum.]{Solar neutrino spectrum. Taken from~\cite{solarNuFluxes}. Although $^{8}\text{B}$ neutrinos are not the most numerous, they are more readily detected than other more numerous neutrinos which are lower energy.}
  \label{fig:solarNuFluxes}
\end{figure}

The SNO detector is a Cherenkov detector with an inner target mass of 1~kt of heavy water located near Sudbury, Canada.
This heavy water target allows it to measure both charged and neutral current neutrino interactions and distinguish between the two~\cite{snoCombined}. An upgraded version of the experiment, SNO+, is currently taking data~\cite{snoPlus}. 
The Super-Kamiokande detector consists of a water Cherenkov detector with a 22~kt fiducial mass located 1000~m underground in Kamioka, Japan and began taking data in 1996~\cite{superKReview}.
Finally, in contrast to the other two experiments which use Cherenkov light to detector charged particles, the Borexino experiment instead uses a spherical tank containing 278~t of liquid scintillator to detect neutrino interactions.

Additionally, the Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Antineutrino Detector (KamLAND) experiment, located in Japan, is also able to constrain \thetai{12} and \deltami{21} using the flux of \anue from a number of nuclear reactors located at baselines of around 100~km in Japan.
The detector consists of 1~kt of liquid scintillator surround by photomultiplier tubes~\cite{kamland}.
Electron antineutrinos are detected via inverse beta decay and resulting emission of a positron and a neutron (which undergoes neutron capture).
The measured rate of antineutrinos is then compared to that expected based on the output of the various reactors.

The KamLAND best fit point lies at $\deltami{21} = 7.54^{+0.19}_{-0.18} \times 10^{-5}~\text{eV}^{2}$ and $\ssthetai{12}=0.325^{+0.039}_{-0.039}$~\cite{kamland}.
This result is in slight tension with those measured by solar experiments, for example SNO gives a measurement of $\deltami{21}=7.41^{+0.21}_{-0.19} \times 10^{-5}~\text{eV}^{2}$ and $\ssthetai{12}=0.308^{+0.014}_{-0.014}$.
This tension is shown in greater detail in \citefig{fig:kamlandPlusSolar} where one can see that the best fit point measured by the solar neutrino experiments lies outside of the 99.73\% confidence limit.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Measurement of \thetai{13}}
\label{sec:theory:currentState:theta13}

\thetai{13} is usually measured using reactor neutrino experiments at baselines of $\order{\SI{1}{\kilo\metre}}$, however it is also possible to measure it using long-baseline \nue appearance in a beam of \numu.
Energies for long baseline experiments are $\order{\SI{1}{\giga\electronvolt}}$ which, given the value of \deltami{32}, requires a baseline of a few \SI{100}{\kilo\metre} to observe oscillations.
Typically, electron antineutrinos emitted by reactors are of a much lower energy (around \SI{4}{\mega\electronvolt}) and thus baselines of around a kilometre are required.
The \anue survival probability can be approximated as 
\begin{equation}
  P(\anue \rightarrow \anue) = 1 - \sstwothetai{13}\sin^{2}\left( 1.27 \frac{\deltami{31}L}{E} \right) + \order{10^{-3}}
\end{equation}
where the smallness of the third term is due to the smallness of the ratio $\deltami{21}/\deltami{21}$~\cite{kuze2013measurements}.

For many years, due to its small size, a measurement of \thetai{13} was not able to be made and only upper limits could be determined.
However, a non-zero value of \thetai{13} was determined in 2012 by the Daya Bay experiment which found a value of $\sstwothetai{13} = 0.092\pm0.016(\text{stat.})\pm0.005(\text{syst.})$~\cite{dayaBay}.

The Daya Bay experiment consists of electron antineutrino detectors situated at three underground sites, two of which are positioned close to reactors and a far site which is \SI{1910}{\metre} and \SI{1540}{\metre} from the two near sites.
The detector medium is Gd-loaded liquid scintillator which is surrounded by PMTs to detect charged particles and gamma rays coming from neutron capture~\cite{dayaBayDetector}.

Results from the Reactor Experiment for Neutrino Oscillation (RENO)~\cite{reno} and Double Chooz~\cite{doubleChooz} experiments, which operate under similar principles to Daya Bay, are in agreement with this measurement.
Up to date measurements of \thetai{13} from these experiments, along with those from the long-baseline experiment T2K are shown in \citefig{fig:theta13Measurements}.

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

\subsection{Measurement of \thetai{23} and \deltami{32}}
\label{sec:theory:currentState:lbl}

Measurements of \thetai{23} and \deltami{32} are primarily made by observing long baseline \numu disappearance and \nue appearance.
There are both accelerator neutrino experiments such as MINOS, MINOS+, T2K and NOvA and experiments which detect atmospheric neutrinos such as Super-Kamiokande and IceCube which aim to measure these parameters.

All of the accelerator experiments utilise two detectors, a near detector within a few hundred metres of the neutrino production target and a far detector several hundred kilometres away where the oscillated spectrum is measured.
\citetab{tab:lblExp} shows the baseline, peak beam energy, far detector technology and operating years for each of these experiments.
For these experiments, the near detector constrains systematic uncertainties on the neutrino beam flux and cross-section while the far detector measures the number of neutrino events as a function of neutrino flavour and energy.

  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Atmospheric neutrino experiments utilise the flux of \numu and \nue created by pion decay in the atmosphere.
Depending on the direction from which the neutrino enters the detector, it may have travelled a wide variety of distances from its point of production.
For example, if travelling upwards it may have travelled the diameter of the Earth, while if travelling downwards it may only have travelled a few kilometres from its point of production.

The Super-Kamiokande experiment is a water Cherenkov detector with a \SI{22.5}{\kilo\tonne} fiducial mass which also acts as the far detector for the T2K experiment.
The IceCube experiment is situated at the South Pole and consists of multiple vertical `strings' of PMTs which are sunk in to the antarctic ice over a \SI{1}{\km\cubic} volume.
The central part of the volume (known as ``DeepCore'') is more densely instrumented and allows for the detection of lower energy neutrinos (a threshold of \SI{5}{\giga\electronvolt})~\cite{icecube}.

\citefig{fig:theta23deltam} shows the current limits set by these various experiments on \ssthetai{23} and \deltami{32}.
One can see clearly that the octant of \thetai{23} is not yet known.

\subsection{Measurement of \dcp}
\label{sec:theory:currentState:dcp}

The CP-violating phase of the PMNS matrix, \dcp, is the least well-known of any of the neutrino oscillation parameters.
The value of \dcp is primarily measured using the appearance of \nue in a \numu beam and \anue in a \anumu beam.
The long baseline experiments, T2K, NOvA and MINOS have all set limits on the value of \dcp thus far.
However, in order to attain a $5\sigma$ measurement of \dcp, the next generation of oscillation experiments will be required.
