%%% Overall point of this chapter: How do our uncertainties relate to our ability to measure CPV
As covered in \citechap{sec:dune}, DUNE's primary goal is to make a measurement of CP violation (CPV) in the lepton sector.
Prior to any construction of the experiment, it is important to assess DUNE's eventual sensitivity to both CPV and other oscillation physics, such as the neutrino mass ordering.
