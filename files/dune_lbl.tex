\chapter{DUNE long baseline analysis}
\label{sec:dune_lbl}

%%% Overall point of this chapter: How do our uncertainties relate to our ability to measure CPV
As covered in \citechap{sec:dune}, DUNE's primary goal is to make a measurement of CP violation (CPV) in the lepton sector.
Prior to any construction of the experiment, it is important to assess DUNE's eventual sensitivity to both CPV and other oscillation physics, such as the neutrino mass ordering.

\section{Summary of DUNE systematic uncertainties}
\label{sec:dune_lbl:systs}

This section gives a summary of the systematic uncertainties used in DUNE's long baseline analysis and where they are derived from.
\citesec{sec:dune_lbl:systs:flux} details the systematics deriving from lack of knowledge about the neutrino beam (commonly referred to as the `flux' systematics).
\citesec{sec:dune_lbl:systs:xsec} gives details of those systematics relating to lack of knowledge surrounding neutrino interactions with matter.
Finally, \citesec{sec:dune_lbl:systs:det} outlines the systematic uncertainties which derive from the uncertainty surrounding detector effects, for example the energy scale of the detector.

\subsection{Flux}
\label{sec:dune_lbl:systs:flux}

Uncertainties in the neutrino beam flux primarily arise from two sources: uncertainties in the production of hadrons by protons striking the beam target and uncertainties in the design parameters of the beam such as the horn currents or positioning (commonly referred to as the ``focussing uncertainties''.

The focussing uncertainties are evaluated by varying the beamline parameters within their tolerances and observing the resulting changes in the neutrino fluxes.
Hadron production uncertainties are estimated using uncertainties from thin target data experiments such as NA49~\cite{na49} with large uncertainties assigned to those interactions that are not covered by data.

\citefig{fig:fluxUncertainties} shows these uncertainties as a function of neutrino energy for the \numu and \anumu fluxes in both neutrino and antineutrino mode.
One can see that, at nearly all energies, hadron production uncertainties are larger than focussing uncertainties.

\subsection{Neutrino interaction (cross-section)}
\label{sec:dune_lbl:systs:xsec}

Uncertainties in the neutrino interaction model come from a variety of sources. 
The primary model used in the DUNE long-baseline analysis 

\subsection{Detector}
\label{sec:dune_lbl:systs:det}

Detector systematics in the DUNE long-baseline analysis primarily take the form of bin-to-bin shifts, rather than the weights typically used for the flux and cross-section systematics.
For various particle types there exist multi-parameter energy scale shifts of the form
\begin{equation}
E_{\alpha,~\text{reco}}' = E_{\alpha,~\text{reco}} \left( p_{0} + p_{1} \sqrt{E_{\alpha,~\text{reco}}} + \frac{p_{2}}{\sqrt{E_{\alpha,~\text{reco}}+0.1}} \right) \, ,
\label{eq:energyResponse}	
\end{equation}
where the $p_{n}$ are allowed to vary in any fits.
\citetab{tab:energyScaleParams} shows the $1\sigma$ values of the $p_{n}$ for each of the particle types.
All of these uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated between the near and far detectors.

The values of the $p_{0}$ (the absolute scale factors) are motivated by those values achieved in current long baseline neutrino experiments which use similar reconstruction techniques.
For example, the NOvA experiment quotes an absolute muon energy scale of $<1\%$ and a proton energy scale of 5\%~\cite{nova2018}.

\begin{table}

		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\citefig{fig:protonEScale} shows 10 possible realisations of the proton energy response.
To produce each of these response functions, the $p_{n}$ are each independently thrown according to a Gaussian distribution with the appropriate width from \citetab{tab:energyScaleParams}.
One can see that between the different throws there are significant differences in both the magnitude and shape of response function between different throws.

\end{figure}

Additionally, a 2\% uncertainty is assigned to the the resolution of each of muon, charged hadrons, electromagnetic objects while a 40\% uncertainty is applied to the resolution of neutrons.

There are however, some detector systematics which are implemented as weights. 
Notably a normalisation uncertainty of 1\% is applied to both \numu and \nue events.

Furthermore, systematic uncertainties for the near detector acceptance are devised based upon simulation.
The acceptance of the DUNE ND is quite different to that of the FD due to the vastly different dimensions of the two detectors
The muon acceptance of the DUNE near detector as a function of muon transverse and longitudinal momentum is shown in \citefigL{fig:ndAcceptance}. 
Muons are considered to be accepted if they either stop within ND-LAr or if they exit ND-LAr and pass into ND-GAr where their momentum may be measured from track curvature.
Those muons which exit ND-LAr without passing into ND-GAr are not accepted.

Neutrino events are rejected where they produce deposits of more than \SI{30}{\MeV} in the veto region of ND-LAr.
This veto region is defined as the outer \SI{30}{\cm} of the active region on all sides.
The resulting hadronic acceptance is shown in \citefigR{fig:ndAcceptance}.
One can see that the acceptance declines sharply as hadronic energy increases.

Right: Hadronic acceptance for CC muon neutrino interactions in ND-LAr as a function of true hadronic energy. Both from~\cite{Abi:2020qib}.}
	\label{fig:ndAcceptance}
\end{figure}

The uncertainty on the muon and hadron acceptance is produced from the respective plots in \citefig{fig:ndAcceptance} with a higher uncertainty in regions where the acceptance is rapidly changing and thus vulnerable to mismodelling.
