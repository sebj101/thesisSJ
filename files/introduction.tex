%%% Explanations of what is in each chapter
\citechap{sec:theory} provides the theoretical background for much of this thesis.
We begin with a brief history of discoveries in the neutrino sector to provide
In particular, a theoretical overview of the neutrino, its interactions and the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations is given.
The chapter concludes by presenting the current experimental status of neutrino oscillations and prospects for the future.

\citechap{sec:dune} gives an overview of the DUNE experiment. 
This includes a description of the physics goals of the experiment, the technologies used in the detectors. 
A brief summary, including key technical details, is provided for each part of the experiment.

\citechap{sec:dune_lbl} expands on the previous chapter by providing an assessment of the systematic uncertainties assumed by DUNE.
Also explored is the effect these uncertainties have on the sensitivity of DUNE to various physical parameters involved in neutrino oscillations.
